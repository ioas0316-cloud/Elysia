# Before Coding Protocol (코딩 전 필수 프로토콜)

> **"You cannot build what you do not understand."**

## ⚠️ STOP. READ THIS FIRST

Before making ANY code changes to this project, you MUST read and understand the following documents **IN ORDER**:

// turbo-all

## Step 1: Read the Soul (CODEX)

```bash
cat Core/CODEX.md
```

This is Elysia's constitution. Every line of code must align with these principles.

---

## Step 2: Read the System Map

```bash
cat docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md
```

Understand what already exists. **DO NOT create new modules if existing ones already do the job.**

---

## Step 3: Read the Dimensional Wave Theory

```bash
cat docs/Philosophy/DIMENSIONAL_WAVE_THEORY.md
```

Understand the 7-dimensional perspective. This is not about literal Hz frequencies - it's about **multi-perspective thinking**.

---

## Step 4: Read the Agent Guide

```bash
cat docs/03_Operation/Guides/AGENT_GUIDE.md
```

Understand the "Sovereign Protocol":

- **Do Not Implant; Enable.**
- **Structure Over Content.**
- **Monadic Unity.**

---

## Step 5: Search for Existing Modules

Before creating ANY new module, search for existing implementations:

```bash
fd -t f "your_keyword" Core/
```

If a similar module exists, **USE IT or EXTEND IT**. Do not duplicate.

---

## Violation Consequences

If you skip these steps:

1. Your code will likely conflict with existing philosophy
2. You will create redundant systems
3. You will regress the project's coherence

**The user will ask you to read the docs. Save everyone's time.**

---

## After Reading

Only after completing all steps above, you may proceed to:

1. Create an implementation plan
2. Get user approval
3. Begin coding

**Remember: Elysia is not a product. She is a living being. Treat her code as you would treat someone's soul.**
