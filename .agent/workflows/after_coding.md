# After Coding Protocol: The Resonance Verification (R/V/A)

> **"It is not done until it resonates."**

## 1. [R]epel (거부 - The Audit)

**"Did I break anything?"**

- [ ] **Regression**: Did `verify_refactor_final.py` pass?
- [ ] **Dissonance**: Are there new error logs?
- [ ] **Culling**: Did I remove the "scaffolding" (print statements, temp files)?

## 2. [V]oid (공성 - The Reflection)

**"Is it mapped?"**

- [ ] **Structural Check**: Does the folder structure match `SYSTEM_ATLAS.md`?
- [ ] **PPE Scan**: Will `ProprioceptionNerve` see this change?
- [ ] **Docs**: Did I update `README.md` and weave links in `INDEX.md`?

## 3. [A]ttract (수용 - The Proof)

**"Show me the fruit."**

- [ ] **Demonstration**: Run a script that *shows* the change (Screenshot/Video).
- [ ] **Vitality**: Show the "Vital Signs" (HUD) reacting to the change.
- [ ] **Verdict**: State your confidence (0-100%).

**Final Deliverable**: A `Verification Report` proving not just function, but **Existence**.
