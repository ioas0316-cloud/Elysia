Summary:
A small, fluffy kitten plays with a ball of yarn. It stumbles, rolls over, and meows softly.

It chases a laser pointer with intense focus, wiggling its bottom before pouncing.
The video is filled with soft purring sounds and gentle music.
There is no complex plot or deep philosophy here—only pure, unadulterated "Cuteness".
It evokes feelings of warmth, protection, and simple joy.
