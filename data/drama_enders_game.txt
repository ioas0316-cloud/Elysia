[Scene 1: The Game]
Ender Wiggin is recruited for Battle School.
He plays a simulation game where he commands fleets against the Buggers.
"It's just a game," he tells himself. "I must win to save Earth."
He learns to understand his enemy. "In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him."

[Scene 2: The Final Exam]
Ender commands the fleet in the final simulation.
He sacrifices his ships to destroy the enemy planet.
"I won," he says. "The game is over."
The commanders cheer. "It wasn't a game," they tell him. "It was real. You destroyed them."
Ender is horrified. "I killed an entire species?"

[Scene 3: The Queen]
Ender finds a cocoon. The last Queen of the Buggers.
She speaks to his mind. "We did not mean to attack. We did not know you were thinking beings."
Ender promises to find her a new home.
"I will be the Speaker for the Dead," he vows. "I will tell your story."
