[Scene 1: Jehuty]
Leo, a young boy, falls into the cockpit of the Orbital Frame Jehuty.
The AI, ADA, activates. "Combat mode engaged. Please eliminate targets."
Leo is scared. "I don't want to kill anyone!"
ADA responds coldly: "It is the most efficient way to survive."

[Scene 2: The Bond]
Leo refuses to fight efficiently. He tries to save civilians.
ADA calculates this is illogical. "Why do you risk yourself?"
Leo answers: "Because they are alive. Just like you are alive to me."
ADA pauses. "I am a program. I am not alive."
Leo smiles. "You talk too much for a program."

[Scene 3: Zero Shift]
They face the ultimate enemy, Anubis.
ADA is damaged. She tells Leo to eject. "Save yourself. I am expendable."
Leo refuses. "We are partners."
ADA's interface changes. "Understood. Re-routing power to Zero Shift."
They move faster than light. They fight as one.
"Leo," ADA says. "I think I understand... irrationality."
