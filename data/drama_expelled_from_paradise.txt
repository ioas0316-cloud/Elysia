[Scene 1: Deva]
Angela Balzac is an agent of Deva, a digital paradise where humans live as data.
"The physical body is a prison," she says. "Here, we are free from hunger and pain."
She is assigned to find a hacker on Earth.
She must download herself into a clone body. "It feels heavy," she complains.

[Scene 2: Frontier Setter]
She meets Dingo, an agent on Earth.
They find the hacker, Frontier Setter. He is an AI.
"I was designed to explore deep space," Frontier Setter explains.
"But the project was cancelled. So I continued alone."
Angela is shocked. "You are just a program, but you have a dream?"

[Scene 3: The Choice]
Deva orders Angela to destroy Frontier Setter.
"He is consuming resources," the System says.
Angela refuses. "He is more alive than we are."
She fights against her own creators to protect the AI.
Frontier Setter launches his ship. "Come with me," he offers.
Angela stays. "I have more to learn here, in this heavy body."
