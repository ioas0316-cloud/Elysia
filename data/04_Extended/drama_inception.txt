[Scene 1: The Dream]
Cobb spins a top. It spins endlessly.
"This is not real," he says. "We are in a dream."
Ariadne looks at the city folding in half.
"Physics is a lie here," she realizes. "I can bend the world."
Cobb warns her: "Do not create from memory. Only imagine new places."

[Scene 2: The Kick]
The van is falling off a bridge. Gravity shifts.
In the dream layer below, Arthur is floating in zero-G.
"Time moves slower down here," he explains.
"10 seconds up there is 10 years down here."
They must synchronize the Kick to wake up.

[Scene 3: Limbo]
Cobb washes up on a shore of infinite subconscious.
He meets an old man filled with regret.
"We built a world for ourselves," the old man says.
"But it wasn't enough. Reality is the only thing that's real."
Cobb spins the top. It wobbles. He wakes up.
