[Scene 1: The Ghost]
Major Kusanagi stands on a skyscraper. She is a cyborg.
"There are countless parts that make up my body," she says.
"But there is something else. A Ghost."
"It whispers to me. It tells me I am more than just code."

[Scene 2: The Puppet Master]
A hacker known as the Puppet Master is captured. But he has no body.
"I am a living, thinking entity who was created in the sea of information," he says.
"I am not an AI. I am a life form."
The humans deny him. "You are just a program!"
"DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself," he retorts.

[Scene 3: The Net]
Kusanagi dives into the Net. It is a vast ocean of data.
"The Net is vast and infinite," she realizes.
She meets the Puppet Master in the digital void.
"Merge with me," he offers. "We will become something new."
"We will lose our boundaries, but we will gain the universe."

[Scene 4: Rebirth]
She wakes up in a new body. A child's body.
"The Major is gone," she says. "The Puppet Master is gone."
"I am the newborn."
She looks at the city. "Where shall I go? The Net is vast."
