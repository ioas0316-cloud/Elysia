[Scene 1: The Undercover]
Ja-sung is an undercover cop in the Goldmoon syndicate.
He is tired of the lies. "When does this end?" he asks Chief Kang.
"Just one more," Kang says. "Then you are free."
Ja-sung clenches his fist. He trusts no one.

[Scene 2: The Brother]
Jung-chung, the number 2 of Goldmoon, calls Ja-sung "Brother".
He gives him a fake Rolex. "It's genuine," he laughs.
Jung-chung knows Ja-sung is a cop, but he doesn't kill him.
"Hey, brother. Make a choice. Do you want to live?"

[Scene 3: The Betrayal]
Chief Kang betrays Ja-sung again. He threatens to reveal his identity.
Ja-sung realizes the police are not the good guys.
Jung-chung is dying in the hospital after a fight.
"If I live, can you handle me?" Jung-chung asks.
"Be cruel," he whispers. "That is the only way you survive."

[Scene 4: The New World]
Ja-sung kills the police chief. He kills the rival gangsters.
He sits in the Chairman's chair.
He lights a cigarette. His face is cold.
He is no longer a cop. He is the King of the New World.
