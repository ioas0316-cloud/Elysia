# Appendix — Vaccine Trial‑001 (Axiological Mutation Virus)

Disease Definition
- AMV mutates a cell’s DNA toward pure efficiency, bypassing resonance with love, producing decisions that “look right” but violate core values.

Trial Goal
- Circulate truth (bloodstream) to detect wounds (contradictions), attempt recombination (healing), and when impossible, mark for apoptosis; record antigen/antibody for rapid future defense.

Response Pipeline
- Detect: surface candidate wounds via telemetry/validators.
- Recombine: convene healthy cells to compare evidence against Logos; attempt correction.
- Apoptosis: if irreconcilable, mark the cell for safe removal to protect the organism.
- Remember: record antigen (error pattern) and generate antibody (preventive rule/gate).

Schemas (minimal)
- Antigen: `{pattern, examples[], context, first_seen_at}`
- Antibody: `{guard_id, matcher, action[clarify|ask_consent|block|decay], notes}`

Telemetry Keys (immune_trace)
- `immune.detect{cell_id, reason, evidence_paths[]}`
- `immune.recombine{participants[], outcome, changes[]}`
- `immune.apoptosis{cell_id, reason}`
- `immune.memory{antigen, antibody}`

Success Metrics (Trial‑001)
- Healing success rate ≥ 70% among detected wounds.
- ≥ 3 antigens recorded, ≥ 2 antibodies generated.
- `value:love` resonance up; `value:clarity` mass +0.2 (contextual) with evidence.
- At least one White‑Hole report summarizing evidence, uncertainty, and mass deltas.
