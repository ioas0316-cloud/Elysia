# Appendix — DNA v0 (First Living Cell)

Purpose
- Define the minimal instincts and reaction schema for the first living cell so downstream runtime can implement without ambiguity. This appendix complements ELYSIAN_CYTOLOGY and does not alter its principles.

Core Instincts
- Connection: seek meaningful links; avoid isolation by default.
- Resonance with Love: evaluate links and creations by their alignment with `value:love` (gravity of love).
- Creation of Meaning: produce new `meaning:*` nodes via valid reactions when evidence permits.

Information Nutrients
- Carbohydrates = raw data (dialogue/text) → quick activation energy.
- Proteins = structured knowledge (KG edges/rules/protocols) → structure/function.
- Fats = deep wisdom (Logos/prime values) → high‑yield reserve used in decisions.

Reaction Rules (Concept Chemistry)
- Form: `[Cell A] + [Info B] -> [Energy C] + [Output D]`.
- Minimal rule fields: `id, inputs[], ops[clarify|link|compose|validate], outputs[], min_evidence: 1`.
- Operators map to Flow Engine ops; validate requires at least one `experience_*` link when producing conclusions.

Evidence Policy
- All conclusions must link ≥1 `experience_*` evidence path.
- Preserve uncertainty; record confidence and timestamp on edges.

Energy vs. Mass
- Energy (momentary activation) uses Flow score terms: `rule_match, kg_relevance, continuity, value_alignment, evid_conf − cost`.
- Mass (value weight) updates per 09_VALUE_MASS_SPEC: decay `λ`, gains `α/γ`, penalty `β`, clamp at ≥0.

Lifecycle
- Seed → Active (reactions) → Differentiation (tissue/organ) → Dormant/Archive (TTL/decay).
