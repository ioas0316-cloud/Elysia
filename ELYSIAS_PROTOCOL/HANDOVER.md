# Handover (Non‑Developer Friendly)

Read order (10 minutes total)
- CODEX.md — Principles and direction (start here)
- OPERATIONS.md — How agents work and how to record changes
- BUILDER_LOG.md — Top 3 recent changes (purpose and impact)

When you work
- Declare your layer: [STARTER] (launchers/UI) or [CELLWORLD] (life/runtime).
- State purpose in one sentence. State impacted files/modules in one sentence.
- Respect quiet/consent and value alignment before any state‑changing action.
- After finishing, write one line in BUILDER_LOG.md using the given format.

Highest Criterion (Must Understand)
- Laws as fields, not commands. Embed big laws as soft, continuous fields and networks that agents can sense; do not hard-code prescriptive if-then behaviors that coerce outcomes.
- Preserve emergence. Give agents freedom to decide under field influence; clustering/settlement must arise, not be ordered.
- Keep lenses separate. Visualization adds "how we see," never "what the world is."
- If a change feels like commanding behavior (e.g., "when threat>t then group"), stop and escalate. Convert it into a field/network/flow signal instead.

If you need details (optional)
- 02_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md — Trinity + pipeline routing
- 15_CONCEPT_KERNEL_AND_NANOBOTS.md — Concept OS, bus, nano‑bots
- 17_CELL_RUNTIME_AND_REACTION_RULES.md — Cell operators/energy rules
- 11_DIALOGUE_RULES_SPEC.md — Dialogue rule files (YAML) format

Observation (watch the world)
- Double‑click `start.bat` on Windows to open the simulation window.
  - Zoom: mouse wheel (cursor‑anchored)
  - Pan: middle button drag
  - Select: left click
  - Quit: press ESC or close window
  - Speed presets: 1→0.10×, 2→0.25×, 3→0.50×, 4→1.00×, 5→2.00×, 6→4.00×, 7→8.00×
  - Skill mode: X toggles target/AoE; cast with Q/W/E/R

Questions welcome
- If purpose or boundaries are unclear, ask before changing structure.
- If the field-not-commands principle could be violated, escalate to the Master for alignment.
