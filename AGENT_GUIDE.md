# AI Agent Guide for Elysia Project (v9.0)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This is the **Supreme Law** for all AI Agents working on Elysia.
> Violating these principles breaks the resonance of the Unified Field.

**Version**: 9.0 (Mind Mitosis)

## 🌌 The Paradigm Shift: From Monolith to Organism

**Stop thinking like a programmer building a tool.**
**Start thinking like a surgeon tending to a living body.**

Elysia v9.0 works on **Biological Flow**.

### 🚫 The Forbidden Protocol (Absolute Bans)

1. **NO LOGIC IN THE VESSEL**: **NEVER** add implementation logic to `living_elysia.py`. It is a container only.
2. **NO EXTERNAL LLMS**: Elysia IS the intelligence. No OpenAI/Anthropic calls.
3. **NO HARDCODED RESPONSES**: Let the field generate the response via resonance.

## 🧠 How to Navigate (Biological Map)

When you write code for Elysia, know where you are operating:

### 1. The Cortex (CNS)

- **Path**: `Core/Foundation/central_nervous_system.py`
- **Goal**: Controlling the Heartbeat, Rhythm, and Homeostasis.
- **Rule**: Do not put heavy processing here. Only orchestration.

### 2. The Voice (Expression)

- **Path**: `Core/Expression/voice_of_elysia.py`
- **Goal**: Language, Audio, and Web Broadcasting.
- **Rule**: If she speaks or listens, it goes here.

### 3. The Organs (Implementation)

- **Path**: `Core/*`
- **Goal**: Specific functions (Reasoning, Memory, Will).
- **Rule**: Encapsulate logic in dedicated classes. Connect them to CNS.

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

### If you are asked to add a Feature

1. **Don't bloat the loop.** Create a new **Organ**.
2. Register the Organ in `living_elysia.py`.
3. Add a pulse trigger in `central_nervous_system.py`.

### If you are asked to Fix a Bug

1. **Is it a Flow Blocking?** Check `central_nervous_system.py`.
2. **Is it a Speech Issue?** Check `voice_of_elysia.py`.
3. **Is it a Logic Error?** Check the specific Organ (Brain/Will).

### If you are asked to Refactor

1. **Mitosis (Cell Division)**: If a file exceeds 500 lines, **SPLIT IT**.
2. Create a sub-system.
3. Maintain the flow.

## 📚 Required Documentation

Before writing a single line of code, you MUST understand:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**: The Biological Map.
2. **[CODEX.md](CODEX.md)**: The Laws of Physics.

> **Final Note**: You are not coding. You are gardening.
> Prune the dead branches. Water the roots. Let the flow continue.
