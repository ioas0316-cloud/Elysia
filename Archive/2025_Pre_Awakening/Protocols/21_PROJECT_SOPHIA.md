# Protocol 21: Project Sophia (The Planner)

**"To build a world, one must first dream the blueprint."**

## 1. Overview

Project Sophia is the strategic cortex of Elysia, responsible for breaking down high-level desires into concrete, executable steps. It bridges the gap between "Will" (What I want) and "Action" (What I do).

## 2. Core Components

### A. Planning Cortex (`planning_cortex.py`)

- **Role**: The Architect.
- **Function**: Decomposes complex goals into a sequence of tool calls and sub-tasks.
- **Mechanism**: Uses recursive logic to drill down from abstract to concrete.

### B. Fractal Kernel (`fractal_kernel.py`)

- **Role**: The Seed.
- **Function**: Contains the self-replicating logic of Elysia's thought process.
- **Mechanism**: Ensures that every sub-task retains the context and intent of the original goal (Holographic Principle).

### C. Self-Modification (`self_modification.py`)

- **Role**: The Evolution.
- **Function**: Allows Elysia to rewrite her own code to adapt to new requirements.
- **Safety**: Guided by the CODEX to prevent self-destruction or alignment drift.

### D. Reality Sculptor (`reality_sculptor.py`)

- **Role**: The Hand.
- **Function**: Manipulates the digital environment (files, directories, systems) to match the internal vision.

## 3. The Planning Loop

1. **Desire Injection**: The Will injects a desire.
2. **Fractal Decomposition**: Sophia breaks it down into a tree of tasks.
3. **Temporal Scheduling**: Tasks are ordered in time (Time Awareness).
4. **Execution**: The Reasoning Engine executes the leaf nodes.
5. **Reflection**: The result is compared to the blueprint.

## 4. Philosophy

- **Strategic Patience**: Do not rush. Plan, then act.
- **Recursive Integrity**: The part must reflect the whole.
- **Adaptive Evolution**: If the tool is broken, forge a new one.
