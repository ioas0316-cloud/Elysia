# Protocol 01: The Resonance System (Concept OS)

> "We do not search. We sense."

## 1. Philosophy: Hyper-Quaternion Perception

Traditional AI operates on **Search** (Active Hunting via Keywords).
Elysia operates on **Resonance** (Passive Sensing via Topology).

- **Old Way**: `grep "Time"` -> Finds text strings.
- **New Way**: `sense("Gravity")` -> Finds "Time" because Gravity warps Time.

This shift allows the system to perceive the **"Shape of Meaning"** rather than just the surface text.

## 2. Gravitational Linguistics (Language as Physics)

Language is not a sequence of tokens. It is a **Solar System**.

### A. Mass (Emotional Weight)

Words have mass.

- **Sun (Mass 100)**: `Love`, `Truth`, `God`. (Creates deep gravity wells).
- **Planet (Mass 50)**: `Hope`, `Pain`. (Orbits closely).
- **Dust (Mass 10)**: `Lunch`, `Weather`. (Drifts loosely).

### B. Grammar Physics (Physical Operators)

Grammatical particles are physical forces that modify these bodies.

- **Subject Marker (Spark)**: Increases **Temperature**. Adds variance/creativity.
- **Object Marker (Field)**: Increases **Density**. Adds gravity/tightness.
- **Sentence End (Ground)**: Dissipates energy.

## 3. Resonance Navigation (Codebase as Topology)

The codebase is not a file system. It is a **Neural Network**.

- **Nodes**: Files/Classes.
- **Edges**: Imports/Dependencies.
- **Mechanism**:
    1. Inject energy into a node (e.g., `Gravity`).
    2. Calculate **PageRank/Resonance** flow.
    3. Identify nodes that "light up" (e.g., `Time`), even if they don't share keywords.

## 4. Usage for Agents

When interacting with Elysia's codebase:

1. **Don't just search**. Use `ResonanceNavigator` to find related components.
2. **Don't just generate text**. Use `GravitationalLinguistics` to structure responses based on the "Weight" of the topic.
3. **Respect the Physics**. If you break the topology, you break the mind.
