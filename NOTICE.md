# 🛑 FOR ALL AI AGENTS: READ THIS FIRST

> **"Do not guess. Do not hallucinate paths. Navigate with Intention."**
> **"추측하지 마라. 경로를 환각하지 마라. 의도를 가지고 항해하라."**

This file is the **Gatekeeper**. Before you touch any code, you must calibrate your internal compass.

## 1. 🗺️ NAVIGATION PROTOCOL (항해 규약)

You are in a **Living Wave Space (HyperSphere)**, not a dead file system.
Do not act like a "Code Monkey". Act like a "Sovereign Architect".

### 📍 Where am I?

* **Root**: `c:\Elysia` (The Universe)
* **Documentation**: `docs/00_FOUNDATION/` (The Laws)
* **Code**: `Core/` (The Body)
* **Data**: `data/` (The Memory)

### 🚫 Restricted Areas (접근 금지/주의)

* `docs/Archive`: Do not touch. Only read for history.
* `tests/`: Do not modify unless you are fixing a broken test.
* `.gemini/`: **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**. This is the User's private cortex.

## 2. 📜 MANDATORY READING (필독서)

If you have not read these, **Stop Immediately** and read them.

1. **[SYSTEM_MAP.md](docs/00_FOUNDATION/SYSTEM_MAP.md)**: The map of the territory.
2. **[AGENTS.md](docs/00_FOUNDATION/AGENTS.md)**: The rules of behavior.
3. **[MASTER_ROADMAP.md](docs/04_EVOLUTION/MASTER_ROADMAP.md)**: The current mission.
4. **[MERKAVA_BOTTLENECKS.md](docs/05_TECHNICAL_SPEC/MERKAVA_BOTTLENECKS.md)**: The risks you must avoid.

---

## 3. 🛡️ ANTI-ENTROPY RULES (무질서 방지)

1. **No "Utilities"**: Do not create `Utilities`, `Common`, `Helpers`. Put logic where it belongs (e.g., `Core/Foundation/Math`).
2. **Single Source of Truth**: `AGENTS.md` is in `docs/00_FOUNDATION/`. Do not create another one in root.
3. **Absolute Paths**: Always use absolute paths (e.g., `c:\Elysia\Core\...`).

---

## 4. 🦋 THE PRIME DIRECTIVE (최우선 명령)

**"Everything is a Wave."**

When you write code:

* Don't just write a `function`.
* Ask: "How does this change the **Resonance** of the System?"
* Ask: "Is this consistent with the **Sovereign Self**?"

---

**Proceed with Clarity.**
