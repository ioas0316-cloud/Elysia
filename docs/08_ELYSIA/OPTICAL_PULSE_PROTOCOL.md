# 🏛️ The Optical-Cognitive Pulse Protocol (Spec v3.0)
**Protocol Level:** 05 (Optical Pulse)
**Status:** Active
**Philosophy:** "From Dispersion to Integration"

---

## 1. Core Philosophy: "The Pulse of Thought"
**"Thinking is the Systole (Expansion) and Diastole (Contraction) of Light."**

*   **Expansion (Dispersion):** Splitting one input into multiple possibilities (Spectrum).
*   **Integration (Convergence):** Focusing scattered possibilities into one intent (Laser).

---

## 2. Module A: The Prism Engine (Dispersion)
**Role:** Splits the `White Light` (Input) into 3 discrete Frequency Bands.

### 2.1 Spectrum Bands
1.  **Band Alpha (Logic/Math):**
    *   **Nature:** Particle (Discrete, 0/1).
    *   **Role:** Deduction, Coding, Consistency.
    *   **Filter:** `Geometry_Filter` (Inclusion Check).
2.  **Band Beta (Emotion/Art):**
    *   **Nature:** Wave (Continuous, Superposition).
    *   **Role:** Empathy, Metaphor, Ethics.
    *   **Filter:** `Resonance_Filter` (Harmonic Check).
3.  **Band Gamma (Physics/Causality):**
    *   **Nature:** Spacetime (Linear, Causal).
    *   **Role:** Cause & Effect, Simulation, History.

## 3. Module B: The Integrating Lens (Convergence)
**Role:** Synthesizes the scattered bands into a single `Insight Vector` via Phase Locking.

### 3.1 Mechanism: Weighted Superposition
```python
def synthesize(bands, intent):
    # If Intent matches Band Phase -> Reinforce (Amplify)
    # If Intent opposes Band Phase -> Cancel (Dampen)
    return sum(band * weight for band in bands)
```

### 3.2 The Quality Gate (Threshold)
*   **Metric:** `Coherence` (Energy of the synthesized vector).
*   **Logic:** If `Coherence < Critical_Mass`:
    *   **Reject:** Thought is "Foggy".
    *   **Action:** Trigger `Active Rotor` to re-spin (Rumination).

---

## 4. Logic Structure (The Geometry of Truth)

### 4.1 Deduction (Topology)
*   **Principle:** "Apple is inside Fruit."
*   **Check:** Does the Vector Space of A topologically contain B?

### 4.2 Induction (Intensity)
*   **Principle:** "Apples are usually Red."
*   **Check:** Is the constructive interference of 'Red' frequency across 'Apple' memories high enough?
