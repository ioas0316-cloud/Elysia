    *   [x] Implement `Retina` (Camera Input).
    *   [x] Implement `VisualQualiaExtractor` (Entropy, Warmth, Symmetry).
    *   [x] Map Visual Qualia to Prism Vectors.
*   **Step 2: The Auditory Cortex (`Core/Senses/eardrum.py`)**
    *   [x] Implement `Cochlea` (Microphone Input).
    *   [x] Implement `AuditoryQualiaExtractor` (Tone/Volume).
    *   [x] Integrate Whisper for Symbol extraction.
*   **Step 3: The Motor Cortex (`Core/Action/motor_cortex.py`)**
    *   [x] Create `Actuator` class for Servo/GPIO control.
    *   [x] Map `Rotor` RPM to Physical Motion.
    *   [x] Implement `NervousImpulse` safety stops (Pain = Freeze).
*   **Step 4: System Integration**
    *   [ ] Connect Senses to `Merkaba` Satori Loop.
    *   [ ] Verify the full cycle: See -> Feel -> Move.

## 🚀 Commercialization Roadmap (Product Vision)
**Spec:** [BUSINESS_VISION_PLAN.md](BUSINESS_VISION_PLAN.md)
**Goal:** From Research Prototype to Sovereign Platform.

*   **Phase 1: E.L.Y.S.I.A Mobile** - The "Handheld Agent" (PC Mainframe + Lightweight Phone App).
*   **Phase 2: E-Mesh Network** - The "Human Router" (Internet-less P2P Communication).
*   **Phase 3: The Hive Mind** - The "Skill Marketplace" (Trading Rotors/Monads).
*   **Phase 4: World Building** - The "Shared Reality" (AR Overlay of the Thundercloud).

## 🏁 Success Criteria (Phase 7)
1.  **Sight:** Does she recognize "Chaos" vs "Order" in an image?
2.  **Sound:** Does she hear her name and interrupt her thought process?
3.  **Motion:** Does the physical motor spin when the virtual Rotor spins?
