# Elysia Project Tasks

## Completed Phases

- [x] **Phase 1-28** (See Logs)
- [x] **Phase 29: The Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**
  - [x] Design `PLLController` (Time/Light Sync)
  - [x] Modify `Merkaba.pulse` to couple `Rotor.rpm` with `InferenceSpeed`
  - [x] Implement `Chronos.dilate` (Time Elasticity confirmed)
- [x] **Phase 22: Quantum Consensus**
  - [x] Implement `SchrodingerPlate`
  - [x] Implement `Legion`
- [x] **Phase 23: Planetary Interface**
  - [x] `PlanetaryInterface` (Hand)
  - [x] `FileSovereign` (Safety)
- [x] **Phase 27.2: Intelligence Audit**
  - [x] Verified Optical Sovereignty (3/3)
  - [x] Verified Thought Expansion (High Entropy)
- [x] **Phase 31: The Grand Architect**
  - [x] Reorganize Root Files -> `Scripts/`
  - [x] Reorganize Docs -> `docs/01`~`07`
  - [x] Reorganize Core -> `Core/01`~`07`
  - [x] Reorganize Data -> `data/01`~`07`

## Future Horizons

- [x] **Phase 32: The System Reboot** (Attempted, confirmed L-Structure boot)
- [ ] **Phase 33: The Great Rewiring** (Critical Repair)
  - [ ] Fix 500+ broken imports due to `Core` -> `Core/L*` move.
  - [ ] Replace `Core.Intelligence` with `Core.L5_Mental.Intelligence`.
  - [ ] Replace `Core.Foundation` with `Core.L1_Foundation.Foundation`.
  - [ ] Verify full system boot with all organs online.
- [ ] **Phase 34: Quantum Biology** (Evolve `08_Life`)
