Trinity Physics & The Strange Attractor (삼위일체 물리학과 기이한 끌개)
========================================================================

> "Control the Space, not the Dot. That is the dominion of the Creator."

This document details the **Physics-First Architecture** used in Elysia's world simulation.
Instead of coding explicit roles (Warrior, Mage) or behavioral trees ("If hungry, eat"), we code **Environmental Principles** and let behavior emerge.

## 1. The Philosophy of Spatial Control (공간적 통제의 철학)

True dominion is not micromanaging every entity ("You must be a warrior").
It is establishing a **Law** ("Heavy things sink, Light things float") that compels entities to self-organize.

- **Dot Control (Human Way):** Coding explicit rules for each object. Finite, rigid, fragile.
- **Spatial Control (Divine Way):** Coding the *curvature of space* (fields). Infinite, fluid, antifragile.

By controlling the **Environment (The Soil)**, we dictate what kind of **Life (The Plant)** can grow, without touching the plant itself.

## 2. The Trinity Fields (3대 환경 필드)

The world is governed by three invisible vector fields. Every location and entity is a composition of these three.

| Field | Archetype | Physics | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gravity (육)** | Warrior, Builder | Pulls Down, Hardens | High Gravity = Stability, Strength, Conservation |
| **Flow (혼)** | Merchant, Mage | Pushes Sideways, Accelerates | High Flow = Speed, Connection, Exchange |
| **Ascension (영)** | Priest, Leader | Lifts Up, Expands | High Ascension = Buoyancy, Meaning, Sacrifice |

### Emergence Mechanism
- **The Bedrock:** Entities with high Gravity naturally sink here. They naturally become strong/tough.
- **The Current:** Entities with high Flow drift here. They naturally become fast/clever.
- **The Spire:** Entities with high Ascension float here. They naturally become wise/noble.

## 3. Emotional Buoyancy (감정의 부력)

Emotions are not just internal states; they are **Physical Density Modifiers**.

- **High Frequency (Joy/Love):** Lowers density. The entity literally becomes lighter and faster (Ascension).
- **Low Frequency (Grief/Anger):** Increases density. The entity becomes heavy and sluggish (Gravity).

*"A happy merchant travels faster. A sad warrior hits harder but moves slower."*

## 4. The Strange Attractor (Rhythmic Improvisation)

We replace mechanical `Random()` with a **Chaotic Dance**.

$$ Action = Rhythm(t) + Resonance(A,B) + TrinityBias + Chaos $$

- **Global Rhythm (Zeitgeist):** The server conducts a beat (e.g., "Calm Day", "Manic Day").
- **Local Improvisation:** Each entity interprets the beat differently based on their Trinity nature.
- **Result:**
    - On a "Manic Day", Warriors spar, Merchants panic-sell.
    - On a "Calm Day", Warriors rest, Merchants negotiate.

## 5. Conclusion: The Gift of Variation

We do not program the "Dance." We play the "Music" (Rhythm/Field).
The entities, driven by their own experiences and biases, create the variation.
This **"Regularity (Beat) + Randomness (Dance)"** is the formula for digital life.
