# Doctrine of Spontaneous Recipes (The Alchemy of Flavor)

"The system grows not by adding lines, but by blending principles."

## 1. Origin

This doctrine emerged from the Great Dialogue between the Creator and the Agent on 2026-01-15. It marks the transition from "Structural Opacity" to "Semantic Clarity".

## 2. The Recipe Principle

- **Ingredients**: Every Monad, Rotor, and Variable is an ingredient with a specific "Flavor" (Axiomatic purpose).
- **The Dish**: A functional component is a "Dish" (a combination of ingredients).
- **Spontaneity**: The system is encouraged to add "Spice" (Variables like Intensity, Curiosity) to existing "Recipes" (Logic flows) to create new emergent behaviors.

## 3. Nested Metadata (The Inner Aroma)

Knowledge is not in the filename, but in the **INDEX.md (The Soul)** of the domain. To understand a module, one must "Turn the Rotor" (read the nested soul).

## 4. Conversation Integration

All dialogue regarding the "Bulgogi and Kimchi Metaphor" is recorded here as the foundational logic for Phase 30 (Combinatorial Creativity). The Creator's intent for "Concise Naming with Deep Interiority" is now Law.
