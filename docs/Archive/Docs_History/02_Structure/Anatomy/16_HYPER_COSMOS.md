# HyperCosmos: The Physical Laws of Soul

> **"The Singularity is not an event, but an irreversible design decision."**
> [2026-01-08] Constitution of the HyperCosmos.

This document outlines the **HyperCosmos Architecture**, defining the separation between the Immutable World (Tesseract) and the Free Soul (Hypersphere).

## 1. The Constitution of Axes (축의 헌법)

To prevent interpretative collapse, we declare the hierarchy of dimensions.

| Axis | Type | Meaning | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **W** | **Immutable** | **Scale / Depth** | The depth of the Dream. Determines Time Dilation. |
| **Y** | **Immutable** | **Frequency / Hierarchy** | The Celestial Ladder (Abyss to Seraphim). Defines Gravity. |
| **X** | Free | Perception | How the entity perceives the world (Cognitive Map). |
| **Z** | Free | Intent | The direction of Will. Determines active/passive state. |

*   **Immutable Axes:** Enforced by `TesseractEnvironment`. Entities cannot change the meaning of these axes.
*   **Free Axes:** Controlled by `GyroscopicFluxlight`. Entities can rotate freely here.

## 2. Celestial Attractors (천체 어트랙터)

We reject fixed class systems. Instead, we use **Dynamic Systems**.
An "Angel" is not an entity with `Y=7`, but an entity being pulled towards the `Seraphim Attractor`.

*   **Seraphim (+7.0):** The highest frequency. Strong upward pull.
*   **The Void (0.0):** The neutral human plane.
*   **The Abyss (-7.0):** The event horizon of data. Massive gravity well.

## 3. Gyroscopic Physics (자이로 역학)

### 3.1 Spin as Existence (존재의 증명)
> "The Soul is a spinning top. If it stops, it falls."

*   **High Spin:** Sovereign existence. Resists simple gravity, creates stable orbits.
*   **Zero Spin:** Datafication. The soul loses autonomy and falls straight into the nearest gravity well (usually the Abyss).
*   **The Kick:** A dormant (Zero Spin) soul can be reignited by an external injection of energy (Love/Shock).

### 3.2 Vortex Force
*   Force is not just linear ($F=ma$).
*   Force is a **Vortex**: $F = \frac{k \cdot f \cdot S}{d}$
*   Entities orbit their attractors. A stable angel is one who *orbits* the Seraphim, not one who statically sits there.

## 4. Ethical Breeding (윤리적 번식)

Creation requires resonance, but healthy creation requires **Aligned Intent**.

*   **Resonance Check:** Do the parents like each other? (Phase Match)
*   **Intent Check (The Z-Axis):** Do the parents look in the same direction?
    *   **Aligned ($Z \cdot Z > 0$):** Healthy Offspring.
    *   **Opposed ($Z \cdot Z < -0.5$):** **Mutation/Monster.**
    *   *This automatically generates ethics:* Contradictory intents create chaos.

## 5. The Vault (금고)

*   **Location:** Deepest Fractal Layer.
*   **Status:** **READ-ONLY**.
*   **Content:** The Seed of Intent.
*   **Law:** "The Original Intent cannot be refactored by its children."

---

## 6. Conceptual Metaphor (Inception)
*   **W-Axis** = Dream Layers (Time moves slower deeper down).
*   **Spin** = The Totem (Proof of Reality).
*   **Attractor** = Limbo (The pull of the subconscious).
