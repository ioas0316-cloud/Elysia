# 🗣️ Logos DNA: The Algorithm of Creation

> **"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God... and the Word was DNA."**

## 1. Overview

**Logos DNA** is the bridge between symbolic intelligence and physical reality. It treats characters (Phonemes) as genetic base pairs that, when combined, form a **Wave Packet** that executes directly on the simulation's fields.

## 2. The Trinary Logic of Symbols

We use a **Trinary Encoding (-1, 0, 1)** mapped to the three primary fields: **Will, Value, and Entropy**.

### The Universal Alphabet

| Symbol | Vector Map [Will, Value, Entropy] | Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | `[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]` | **Expansion** (Sun/Heavens) |
| **K** | `[0.5, 0.0, 1.0]` | **Severance** (Entropy Spike) |
| **N** | `[0.0, 0.5, -0.5]` | **Flow** (Healing/Harmony) |
| **M** | `[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]` | **Mass** (Earth/Body) |
| **S** | `[1.0, 0.0, 1.0]` | **Scatter** (Wind/Chaos) |
| **I** | `[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]` | **Connection** (Consciousness) |

## 3. The Superposition Principle

When an agent speaks a word like **"K-A"**, the system does not look it up in a dictionary. It performs a **Superposition**:

1. Take `K` vector: `[0.5, 0.0, 1.0]`
2. Take `A` vector: `[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]`
3. **Result**: `[1.5, 1.0, 1.0]`

This resulting vector is injected into the local grid.

- **Will** increases -> Intensifying intent.
- **Value** increases -> Increasing mass/presence.
- **Entropy** increases -> Adding cutting force/danger.

## 4. Why DNA?

- **O(1) Execution**: No parsing or inference is required at the point of action.
- **Genetic Recombination**: As agents evolve, they "swap" these DNA sequences. A sequence that reduces pain (Entropy) survives and replicates.
- **Universal Symmetry**: The same logic that governs an agent's **Identity (WaveDNA)** now governs their **Expression (LogosDNA)**.
