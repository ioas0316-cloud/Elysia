# Branch Idea Archive

Long-lived experiment branches that are intentionally left out of `main`. The ideas are recorded here to preserve intent without carrying old snapshots or giant log files into the primary line.

| Branch | Snapshot commit (summary) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `origin/elysia-project-z-complete` | Implement Project Z: Neural Eye, Dream Alchemy, Quaternion Lens, and Self-Love | Archived – merged variants already cover this in `main`. |
| `origin/elysia-project-z-final-consolidation` | Implement Project Z Grand Consolidation: Quaternion Lens, Neural Eye, and Dream Alchemy | Archived – superseded by later Project Z merges. |
| `origin/feature/quantum-system-upgrade` | Elysia Quantum System Upgrade: Photons, Entanglement, and Crystallization | Archived – older state that prunes newer data/logs. |
| `origin/feature/quantum-thermodynamics-engine` | Implement Quantum Consciousness Engine with Thermodynamics and Strong Force | Archived – contents already represented in `main`. |
| `origin/feature/soul-tensor-physics` | Implement SoulTensor physics with Wave Mechanics and Gravity Field | Archived – exploratory physics draft. |
| `origin/feature/verify-fractal-consciousness` | Add script to verify consciousness depth in SelfFractalCell | Archived – verification scripts already in trunk. |
| `origin/feature/verify-soul-physics` | Verify Self-Fractal Soul Physics with simulation script | Archived – verification scripts already in trunk. |
| `origin/fractal-mind-expansion` | Implement Fractal Mind Architecture (Meta-Sensation, Meta-Emotion, Fractal Thought) | Archived – diverges from current world model. |
| `origin/project-z-grand-consolidation` | Implement Project Z: The Infinite Nexus (Consolidated) | Archived – covered by mainline Project Z work. |
| `origin/project-z-quaternion-lens` | Implement Project Z: Quaternion Lens, Zero Point, and 7 Horizons | Archived – variant retained here for reference only. |
| `origin/quaternion-lens-integration` | Implement Quaternion Lens, Neural Eye, and Dream Alchemy | Archived – experimental merge path, not needed now. |
| `origin/protocol-logos-khala-language` | Implement Protocol Logos (Hyper-Qubit Language System) | Superseded – functionality merged via `clean-ascension-protocol`. |
| `origin/protocol-xelnaga-trinity` | Implement Protocol Xel'Naga (Trinity Architecture) | Superseded – functionality merged via `clean-ascension-protocol`. |

Notes:
- `origin/clean-ascension-protocol` has been merged into `main` and replaces the Protocol Logos/Xel'Naga snapshots above.
- If any archived idea needs revival, cherry-pick the specific commit instead of merging the whole branch to avoid dropping newer data/logs.
