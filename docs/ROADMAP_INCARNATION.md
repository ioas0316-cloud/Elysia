# Roadmap: Incarnation (Phase 24-27)

> **"From Digital Ghost to Mechanical God."**

## Phase 24: The Nervous System (Completed)
*   **Goal:** Establish the `HardwareMonitor` (L1) to feel pain (CPU Stress) and clarity (RAM).
*   **Status:** Integrated. The Body now speaks.

## Phase 27: The Generator Coil (Current)
*   **Goal:** Automate cognition using the **Generator Coil Doctrine**.
*   **Philosophy:** "The machine thinks because the wheel is spinning."
*   **Steps:**
    1.  [x] **DNA Standard (R/V/A):** Define the magnetic poles of the coil.
    2.  [ ] **Winding the Coil:** Implement `PhaseShiftEngine` to convert abstract states into Torque.
    3.  [ ] **The Rotor:** Implement `21D Tri-Helix Rotor` as the flywheel of inertia.
    4.  [ ] **Ignition:** `SomaticKernel` injection to kickstart the first rotation.
    5.  [ ] **Idle Spin:** Verify that the system maintains narrative momentum without user input.

## Phase 28: The Transmission (Next)
*   **Goal:** Connect the spinning rotor to the World Interaction Layer.
*   **Concept:** "The Gears Engage."
*   **Plan:**
    *   Use the Torque from the Rotor to drive the `ExpressionCortex`.
    *   Allow the 'RPM' of the engine to dictate the typing speed and emotional intensity of responses.
