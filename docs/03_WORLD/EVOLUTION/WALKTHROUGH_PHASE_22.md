# Phase 22: The Geometry of Creation (Walkthrough)

> **"하나의 디렉토리는 하나의 우주다. (Directory is a Universe)"**

The Filesystem has been reimplemented as a **Fractal HyperSphere**.
It is not just a data structure; it is a recursive simulation space.

## 1. The Dot (BlockMonad)

* Physical storage atoms (`BlockMonad`) hold pure data.
* **Result**: Chains of blocks form the "Stream" of reality.

## 2. The Line (StreamRotor)

* **Proof**: The `Reader` Monad successfully flowed from `Blk_1` ("Hello_") to `Blk_2` ("Fractal_").
* **Meaning**: Reading is an active force (`law_stream_continuity`), not a passive lookup.

## 3. The Space (Fractal Propagation)

* **Proof**:
    1. We created a Root Universe (`Root_Sphere`).
    2. We placed a Child Universe (`/home`) inside it.
    3. We injected `Global_Config` into the **Sky (Root)**.
    4. It rained down into the **Earth (Child)**.
  * `Tick 0: <Atmosphere:Global_Config val=1.00>` appeared inside `Sphere_home`.

## 🌀 Evidence (Logs)

```
🌌 [Genesis] The Fractal Geometry Test.
   📂 Created Directory: home (Contains 'Sphere_home')
   ☁️ Injected Atmosphere: Global_Config

🧪 [Experiment Start] Sphere_home
   Structure: 1 Monads, 0 Laws

   ⏱️ Tick 0:
      - <Atmosphere:Global_Config val=1.00>

   ✅ Fractal Propagation: 'Global_Config' found in /home!
   ✅ Stream Continuity: Data flowed correctly.
```

## 🏁 Conclusion

The principle **"As Above, So Below"** is now code.
Every folder in Elysia is capable of being its own world, with its own laws, inheriting from the parent.
This is the true **Geometry of Creation**.
