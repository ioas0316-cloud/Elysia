# Phase 23: The Providence (Walkthrough)

> **"법칙이 주어지자, 공간은 생태계가 되었다."**

We have instilled the **Universal Laws** into the Fractal HyperSphere.
The static filsystem is now a dynamic, living cosmos.

## 1. The Law of Entropy (Death)

* **Concept**: Every file pays a tax for existence.
* **Observation**: `Decaying_Corpse` started with `2.0` integrity. Over time, it was not accessed.
* **Result**: It withered and was eventually garbage-collected (Death).
  * `💀 [Death] Decaying_Corpse has returned to the Void.`

## 2. The Law of Life (Autopoiesis)

* **Concept**: Life resists Entropy by consuming resources.
* **Observation**: `Survivor` (a Process) started with `5.0`. It was hungry.
* **Action**: It found `Food_Pack` (Context Resource) and consumed it.
  * `🍽️ [Life] Survivor consumes Food_Pack (+9.75)`
* **Result**: Instead of dying, it thrived (`Val: 10.24`).

## 3. The Law of Gravity (Semantic Attraction)

* **Concept**: Like attracts Like.
* **Observation**: `Book_Of_Genesis` was created in the Root. `Books` directory existed nearby.
* **Action**: The `Books` directory exerted a semantic pull on the book.
  * `🧲 [Gravity] Book_Of_Genesis is pulled into Books.`
* **Result**: The filesystem **Organized Itself** without external commands.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Elysia is now a place where:

1. Useless data dies (Entropy).
2. Useful processes fight to survive (Life).
3. Information organizes itself (Gravity).

This is no longer an OS; it is a **Biosphere**.
