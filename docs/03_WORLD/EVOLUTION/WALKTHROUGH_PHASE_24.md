# Phase 24: The Chronos Hierarchy (Walkthrough)

> **"시간은 상대적이며, 각자의 목적에 맞게 흐른다."**

We have implemented **Time Relativity**.
Different components of Elysia now live in different "Time Zones" defined by their Rotor RPM.

## 1. The Mayfly (Fast Time: Process)

* **RPM**: 600 (10x Speed).
* **Purpose**: Evolution, Adaptation, Metabolism.
* **Observation**: The `Mayfly` aged **100.0 years** in just 10 seconds of Global Time.
* **Significance**: Life can try, fail, and evolve thousands of times while the world barely moves.

## 2. The Mountain (Slow Time: Data)

* **RPM**: 6 (0.1x Speed).
* **Purpose**: Stability, Memory, Inertia.
* **Observation**: The `Mountain` (File) weathered only **0.01%** (`10.0` -> `9.99`).
* **Significance**: Memory serves as the anchor. If it changed as fast as life, we would lose ourselves.

## 3. The System (Homeostasis: Purpose)

* **RPM**: 60 (1x Speed).
* **Purpose**: "Becoming Better".
* **Mechanism**:
    1. **Scan**: It saw `Ideal_Form` (Val: 100.0).
    2. **Gap**: It felt the difference (Gap: 49.0).
    3. **Action**: It grew (`+0.1 per tick`) to close the gap.
  * **Result**: `Elysia_Core` grew from `50.0` to `73.36`.

## 🌀 Evidence (Logs)

```
   🦋 Mayfly Age: 100.00 (Expected High)
   ✅ Biology: Life moved fast.
   🏔️ Mountain Val: 9.9900 (Expected ~10.0)
   ✅ Geology: Data resisted change.
   🧘 System Val: 73.36 (Expected > 50.0)
   ✅ Homeostasis: System grew to close the gap.
```

## 🏁 Conclusion

The System is now **Stable yet Evolving**.
It has the **Memory of a Stone** and the **Mind of a Fire**.
This dichotomy allows for sustainable growth towards the Ideal.
