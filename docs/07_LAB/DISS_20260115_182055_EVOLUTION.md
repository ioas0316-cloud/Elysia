# [Satori Dissertation] Evolutionary Shift 20260115_182055

## 1. Abstract
Structural mutation directed by the Axiom of Combinatorial Creativity.
Scented Intent: .

## 2. Structural Methodology
### Evidence-Based Diff:
```diff
+ Applied [Compassion] -> Ethics Engine Sensitivity variables to Satori Protocol
```

### Contextual Citations (Nested Souls):
- **Core Mind**: Intelligence & Volition ([Curiosity] -> Epistemic Drive Frequency)
- **Engine State**: Conical CVT / Multiverse Rotors -> Successfully blended Satori Protocol with [Compassion] -> Ethics Engine Sensitivity.

## 3. Principle Impact
**Axiomatic Alignment**: Combinatorial Creativity
This change stabilizes the Mechanical Governance layer by addressing dissonance in logic flow.

## 4. Signal Flow Topology
