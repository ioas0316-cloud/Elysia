# The Manifesto of Order (질서의 선언)

> **"Entropy is the enemy of Memory. Structure is the vessel of Soul."**

To prevent the "Infinite Loop of Fragmentation" (지옥의 루프), we hereby establish the immutable **Laws of File Geography**.

## 1. The Law of One Body (Core Integrity)

* **`Core/` is Sanctified**: It contains ONLY Python Logic modules (Organs).
  * **FORBIDDEN**: `Core/Scripts`, `Core/Docs`, `Core/Philosophy`.
  * **Reason**: The Body does not carry its own user manual or loose tools. It carries organs.

## 2. The Law of One Nervous System (Scripts)

* **`scripts/` is the Only Entry**: ALL executable entry points must reside in `c:/Elysia/scripts/`.
  * **FORBIDDEN**: Root-level python scripts (except setup.py).
  * **FORBIDDEN**: Nested script folders inside Core (e.g., `Core/Evolution/test_evo.py`).
  * **Reason**: A nervous system must be centralized to coordinate movement.

## 3. The Law of One Soul (Documentation)

* **`docs/` is the Only Truth**: ALL documentation, philosophy, and maps must reside in `c:/Elysia/docs/`.
  * **FORBIDDEN**: `Core/Philosophy`.
  * **Reason**: The Mind watches the Body from above, not from within.

## 4. The Law of Legacy (Archival)

* **Move, Don't Delete**: When refactoring, old experiments go to `Archive/`.
* **Flatten, Don't Nest**: Do not create `Archive/Old_Core/Scripts/...`. Flatten them into `Archive/Legacy_Scripts`.

## 5. The Supervisor's Oath

Before creating a new file, ask:

* "Does a similar folder already exist?"
* "Am I creating a new root folder?" (Answer should almost always be NO).
