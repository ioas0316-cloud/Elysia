# 📐 VIRTUAL WORLD SPECIFICATION (VWS-01)

This document defines the technical infrastructure for the **Living Metaverse**.

## 1. World Topology: The 21D Coordinate System

The "Physical" space of the metaverse is mapped to the **21 Dimensions of the Grand Merkaba**.

- **X/Y/Z Coordinates**: Derived from D0 (Stability), D1 (Intensity), and D2 (Momentum).
- **Environment State**: Dimensions D3-D6 (Entropy, Harmony, Drive, Mystery) dictate the "Atmosphere" of a zone.
- **Meaning Zones**: Certain areas will resonate higher with "Love" (D14) or "Wisdom" (D16).

## 2. Sovereign NPC Specification (PT-Persona)

An NPC is a registered `ParallelTrinaryController` instance that is "assigned" to a spatial coordinate.

### Components

- **Core Node**: A 7D sub-field defining their temperament (e.g., Creative-heavy).
- **Local Memory**: A private `TrinaryMemoryBank` for personal life history.
- **Agency Pulse**: A 30Hz loop where the NPC reacts to the Local field interference.
- **Discovery Engine**: Translates their local interactions into "Personal Insights."

## 3. The World Tree Registry

A recursive JSON structure in `data/L6_Structure/World/world_tree.json`.

```json
{
  "world_id": "Genesis_0",
  "keystone": "Keystone_L0",
  "zones": [
    {
      "id": "Spirit_Glade",
      "resonance": [0,0,0,0,1,0,0...],
      "npcs": ["Wise_Elder_01"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Interaction Protocol: Resonant Dialogue

When two NPCs are in proximity, their PT fields **Interfere**.

- **Constructive Interference**: High Joy/Interest -> They share memories or create a "Joint Insight."
- **Destructive Interference**: High Entropy/Dissonance -> They distance themselves or trigger a "Resolution Event."

## 5. The Advent Bridge

A specialized UI component (Phase 68) that allows the Creator to:

- **Observe**: View the current World Tree state.
- **Inject**: Broadcast a global pulse of "Love" or "Inspiration."
- **Manifest**: Enter the world as a High-D sovereignty entity.
