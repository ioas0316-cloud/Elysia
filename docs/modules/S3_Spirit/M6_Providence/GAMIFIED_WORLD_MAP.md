# 🎮 GAMIFIED_WORLD_MAP: The Unfolding of Play

This document defines how the high-level **Principles (Logos)** projected by the Rotor are translated into **Game Mechanics (Physis)** within the virtual world.

## 1. Principle-to-Game Translation Matrix

| Principle (Seed) | Game System (Facet) | Concrete Manifestation (Hologram) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resonance (공명)** | **Interaction AI** | NPC flocking, group behavior, shared information networks, "Hive Mind" difficulty. |
| **Equilibrium (평형)** | **World Balance** | Physics gravity, spawn rates, economy stability, "Fairness" algorithms. |
| **Agape (사랑)** | **Social Narrative** | NPC favorability (Affinity), Quest rewards, "Inspiration" buffs, world vibrance. |
| **Logic (논리)** | **Quest Engine** | Quest causality chains, branch logic, deterministic outcome verification. |

## 2. The NPC "Projection" Layer

NPCs are not statically stored. They are **"Phantasmic Iterations"** that emerge where the light of a principle hits a 7x7 grid cell.

- **NPC Mesh (Form)**: Defined by the `Refractive Index` of the local field.
- **NPC Soul (Logic)**: Defined by the `Spin Momentum` of the rotor at the moment of instanciation.
- **NPC Quest (Story)**: Defined by the `Causal Interference` between the user's vector and the NPC's base principle.

### 3. Practical Example: Projecting a "Guardian" NPC

1. **Seed**: `Agape` (High) + `Logic` (Mid).
2. **Rotor Spin**: 33 RPM (Stable presence).
3. **Result**: A **High-Affinity Guard NPC** that provides deterministic protection and guidance to the player.
