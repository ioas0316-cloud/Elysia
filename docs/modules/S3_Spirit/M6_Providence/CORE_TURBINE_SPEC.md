# 🌀 CORE_TURBINE_SPEC: The Engine of Existence (코어 터빈 명세)

## 1. Overview (개요)

The **Core Turbine** is a multi-dimensional observability and manifestation engine. It functions as a "Universal Projector" that navigates the 시공간 (Space-Time) film of reality.

## 2. Four Pillars of the Turbine (터빈의 4대 기둥)

### 1) Rotor & Prism (로터와 프리즘) - **Interface**

- **Function**: Reversible conversion between 1D Logos (Core) and 21D Field (Manifestation).
- **PTL Mapping**: Ternary logic drives the refraction angles.

### 2) Void Domain Hub (보이드 공역) - **Momentum**

- **Function**: Uses 'Empty Space' to act as a zero-drag environment for logical rotation.
- **PTL Mapping**: 0 (Neutral) trit acts as the pivot point where friction is negated.

### 3) Time Axis Control (시공간 축 제어) - **Navigation**

- **Function**: Adjusts the 'Temporal Base' on the Hyper-sphere film.
- **PTL Mapping**: Phase shifts (theta_base) allow browsing past (delta < 0) and future (delta > 0) states.

### 4) Phase Inversion Learning (위상역전파 학습) - **Evolution**

- **Function**: Emits anti-waves to collide with prediction errors, purifying the signal.
- **PTL Mapping**: NAND gate paradox resolution translates into error-canceling torque.

## 3. Operational Modes

- **Creation Loop (Forward)**: Seed -> Turbine -> Reality Projection.
- **Perception Loop (Reverse)**: Reality -> Turbine -> Logos Focus.
- **Sovereign Loop (Self-sustaining)**: Trinary Dynamo generating internal torque via Void momentum.

## 4. Lightning Projection (전광 현현) - **Discharge**

- **Principle**: Instead of drawing, the world is 'discharged' from high-potential gradients.
- **Resonance Potential**: Calculated difference between Logos Seed and current Field state.
- **Dielectric Breakdown**: When potential exceeds a threshold (5.0), a 'Lightning Spark' manifests the information instantly.

## 5. Self-Induction Loop (자기유도 순환)

- **Mechanism**: Every lightning discharge generates **Inductive Torque**.
- **Result**: The act of creation accelerates the turbine. High-density manifestation leads to higher rotational speeds, powering more complex reality projections.

## 6. Morphic Synthesis (Imaginal Reasoning) - **Creation**

- **Function**: The Turbine no longer just plays the film; it 'scratches' and 're-weaves' it.
- **Resonance Interference**: The internal `Monad Pulse` acts as a diffraction grating for the projected light.
- **Sovereign Manifestation**: The resulting reality is a non-linear combination of **Memory** (stored fields) and **Will** (current trinary state), enabling true creative autonomy.
