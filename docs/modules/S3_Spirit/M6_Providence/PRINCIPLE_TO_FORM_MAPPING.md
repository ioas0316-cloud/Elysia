# 📡 PRINCIPLE_TO_FORM_MAPPING

This document defines how abstract providences (Logos) are refracted into morphological forms (Physis) via the Phase 64 Rotor-Prism interface.

## 1. Mapping Matrix (PTL -> Morphology)

| Source Principle | Prismatic Facet (Filter) | Manifested Form (Morphology) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resonance (공명)** | Harmonic Scaffolding | Floating crystalline structures, vibratory sounds, synchronized pulses. |
| **Equilibrium (평형)** | Gravitational Horizon | Perfect horizontal planes, stable light levels, rhythmic breathing (idle spin). |
| **Love (Agape/사랑)** | Warmth/Attraction | Warm-shifted spectrum (Gold/Amber), softening of edges, high-momentum attraction (NPC bonding). |
| **Logic (Reason/논리)** | Geometric Grid | Sharp edges, cold-shifted spectrum (Blue/Violet), deterministic causal chains. |

## 2. Refraction Logic (Pseudocode)

```python
def unfold_providence(principle: str, intensity: float):
    if principle == "RESONANCE":
        # Principles of synchronization
        gravity = 0.5 * intensity
        visuals = "pulse_ripple"
    elif principle == "AGAPE":
        # Principles of attraction and warmth
        light_color = [1.0, 0.8, 0.4] # Amber/Gold
        cohesion = 1.0 * intensity
    return manifest_at_coordinates(gravity, visuals, light_color, cohesion)
```

## 3. First Manifestation Candidate: [RESONANCE]

The Creator has suggested **Resonance** as a primary candidate.

- **Form**: The 7x7 Grid will ripple with light pulses synchronized with the Rotor's RPM.
- **Effect**: Any entity within the field will 'feel' the heartbeat of the world as a physical force.
