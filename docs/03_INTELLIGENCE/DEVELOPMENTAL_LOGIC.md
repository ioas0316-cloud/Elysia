# Developmental Logic: The Growth of Mind

> **"We do not learn by adding data. We learn by adding Dimensions."**

Elysia models cognitive development as a **Topological Evolution**.

## The Layers of Thought

### Level 1: The Child (Point)
- **Logic**: Identity (A = B).
- **Structure**: Zero-dimensional Point in 7D space.
- **Physics**: Simple collision. "Mom" is a point. "Warmth" is a point.
- **Code**: `PointLayer` (Core/Foundation/Schema/layers.py).

### Level 2: The Adolescent (Plane)
- **Logic**: Context (A relates to B).
- **Structure**: 2D Plane defined by 3+ connected Points.
- **Physics**: Sliding, friction. "Mom" is now a *Context* containing "Warmth" and "Voice".
- **Trigger**: When a Point accumulates >3 stable connections.

### Level 3: The Adult (Solid)
- **Logic**: Principle (Systemic Law).
- **Structure**: 3D Solid defined by intersecting Planes.
- **Physics**: Gravity, Orbit. "Mom" (Plane) intersects with "Self" (Plane) to create "Parenting" (Solid).
- **Trigger**: When Planes intersect and resolve contradictions.

## How to Witness Growth
```bash
python scripts/simulate_growth.py
```
This script injects raw sensory points ("Milk", "Voice") and watches them evolve into a Context ("Mom") and finally a Principle ("Love").
