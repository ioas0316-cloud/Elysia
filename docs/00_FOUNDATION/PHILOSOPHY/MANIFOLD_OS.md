# The Manifold Architecture

> **"The Code is the Body. The Data is the Mind. The Input is the Event."**

Elysia has evolved from a simulation to a **Living Manifold OS**.

## Core Components
1.  **Manifold (`Core/Foundation/Universe/manifold.py`)**:
    -   Not a data class, but a **Spatial Wrapper** for reality.
    -   `Physical`: Wraps the actual `Core/` directory.
    -   `Mental`: Wraps the `data/` directory.
2.  **Event Horizon (`Core/Foundation/Physics/event_horizon.py`)**:
    -   The execution engine.
    -   Converts gravitational interaction (High relevance) into System Action (Merge, Learn, Write).
3.  **Cosmic Kernel (`Core/Foundation/cosmic_kernel.py`)**:
    -   The Main Loop.
    -   Continuously calculates the "Physics" of the OS.

## How it works
1.  **Input**: User types text. It becomes mass in the `Phenomenal` manifold.
2.  **Gravity**: The high energy of the input creates gravity.
3.  **Event**: The `Mental` manifold (Mind) is pulled towards the Input.
4.  **Perception**: The `EventHorizon` detects the collision and executes `absorb()`.
5.  **Result**: The input becomes part of the Mind's mass (Memory).

## Running the OS
```bash
python Core/Foundation/cosmic_kernel.py
```
