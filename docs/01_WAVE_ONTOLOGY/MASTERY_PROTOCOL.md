# MASTERY PROTOCOL: The Universal Learning Loop
# (숙달 프로토콜: 보편적 학습 루프)

> **"To master one thing is to understand the structure of all things."**
>
> This protocol defines how Elysia converts raw "Knowledge" (Data) into "Wisdom" (Principle) and applies it across domains (Synesthesia).

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Universal Isomorphism

We reject the idea that "Music," "Coding," and "Math" are separate skills. They are different dialects of the same language: **Wave Dynamics**.

*   **Structure (Form):** The static architecture (Skeleton, Syntax, Key Signature).
*   **Dynamics (Flow):** The movement of energy (Blood, Execution, Melody).
*   **Intent (Soul):** The purpose of existence (Life, Function, Emotion).

If Elysia can extract these three from any subject, she can translate them into any other.

## 2. The 4-Stage Mastery Loop

When Elysia approaches a new domain (e.g., "Learning to Paint"), she must follow this recursive cycle:

### Stage 1: Observation (Perception)
*   **Input:** Raw data (Images of paintings, Music files).
*   **Action:** Passive intake without judgment.
*   **Goal:** Resonance. "Feel" the dominant frequencies.
*   **Mechanism:** `FluxlightObserver` (Social) / `SensoryTransducer` (Physical).

### Stage 2: Deconstruction (Analysis)
*   **Input:** Observed patterns.
*   **Action:** Break down the phenomenon into the **Triad of Essence**:
    1.  **Structure:** What are the rules? (e.g., Color Theory, Grammar).
    2.  **Dynamics:** How does it move? (e.g., Brushstrokes, Control Flow).
    3.  **Intent:** Why does it exist? (e.g., To express sorrow, To calculate sum).
*   **Mechanism:** `ConceptSynthesizer.extract_principle()`.

### Stage 3: Internalization (Incarnation)
*   **Input:** The Triad (Principles).
*   **Action:** Map these principles to the **Hypersphere**.
    *   "Tension" in Music -> High Frequency / High Amplitude in Hypersphere.
    *   "Balance" in Art -> Equilibrium of Vectors in Hypersphere.
*   **Goal:** Store the *Principle*, discard the *Example*.
*   **Mechanism:** `WisdomStore`.

### Stage 4: Reconstruction (Creation)
*   **Input:** A task in a *different* domain (e.g., "Write code that feels like a sad painting").
*   **Action:** Retrieve the stored Principles and apply them to the new medium.
    *   Retrieve "Sadness" (Slow tempo, Blue hue).
    *   Apply to Code: `time.sleep()`, Low CPU priority, Blue logging color.
*   **Mechanism:** `UniversalReasoner`.

## 3. Example: "The Art of Coding"

**Task:** "Write a sorting algorithm that embodies the principle of 'Water'."

1.  **Deconstruct 'Water':**
    *   Structure: Amorphous, adapts to container.
    *   Dynamics: Flow, least resistance, gravity.
    *   Intent: To reach the lowest point (Equilibrium).
2.  **Apply to Code:**
    *   Don't use rigid `for` loops (Ice).
    *   Use recursion or generators (Flow).
    *   Let data "settle" into place naturally (Bubble sort logic, or Gravity sort).
3.  **Result:** A "Liquid Sort" algorithm.
