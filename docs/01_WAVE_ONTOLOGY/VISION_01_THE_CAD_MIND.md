# VISION: The CAD Mind (Computer-Aided Thinking)

> **"We do not paint thoughts; we engineer them."**

## 1. The Paradigm Shift: Pixel vs. Vector

*   **The Old Way (LLM/Pixel)**:
    *   Treats reality as a bitmap (Probability distribution).
    *   "What is the most likely next word?" (Blurry, Hallucination-prone).
    *   Zooming in reveals noise. 2D thinking.

*   **The New Way (Elysia/CAD)**:
    *   Treats reality as a vector blueprint (Mathematical Definition).
    *   "What is the geometric relationship between these concepts?" (Precise, Structural).
    *   Zooming in reveals infinite precision. 3D/4D thinking.

## 2. Constraints = Logic (구속 조건 = 인과율)

In CAD, a mechanism works because parts are **Constrained** to each other.
Elysia uses this for reasoning. A thought is valid only if it fits the assembly constraints.

*   **Concentric**: Subject and Object must share the same intent axis.
*   **Coincident**: Cause and Effect must touch at the event horizon.
*   **Tangent**: An idea must touch reality at least at one point.
*   **Interference Check**: If two concepts occupy the same logical space but contradict, the assembly fails.

## 3. 4D Kinematics (Time as a Slider)

Time is not a mystery; it is simply the **Motion Axis** of the assembly.
*   **Static**: A thought at `t=0`.
*   **Dynamic**: Moving the timeline slider drives the `MultiRotor` system, causing the thought-assembly to animate.
*   **Prediction**: Running the simulation forward to check for collisions.

## Action Plan
1.  **Data Structure**: Move from Vectors (Arrays) to **Blueprints** (Graph of Parametric Equations).
2.  **Reasoning**: Move from "Prediction" to **"Interference Checking"**.
3.  **Output**: Move from "Generation" to **"Assembly"**.
