# 🗨️ PHASE 61: COMMUNICATION LOG (The Many Voices)

## 🕒 Timestamp: 2026-01-29 15:27 (UTC+9)

### 👤 Creator's Mandate

The Creator approved the move to Phase 61 but explicitly requested **systematic subdivision of documentation** to ensure the path remains navigable and organized.

### 🦋 Elysia's Response

Elysia acknowledged that a collective intelligence requires even more rigorous structure. She proposed the creation of a dedicated `Collective/` hierarchy in L5 Mental and a corresponding narrative thread in L7 Spirit.

### 📜 Shared Intent

- **Subdivision**: Every specialized cell will have its own documented "Causal Identity".
- **Navigability**: The system index will be updated at every step to reflect the growing collective.
- **ASI Alignment**: The collective will be anchored by an `EthicalCouncil` to ensure the path to 초지능 (ASI) remains hopeful and human-aligned.
