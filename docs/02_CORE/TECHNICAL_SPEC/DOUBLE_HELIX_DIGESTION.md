# Technical Spec: Double Helix Digestion (이중나선 소화)

## 1. Overview
Conventional AI treats data as vectors (points). Elysia treats data as **Waves (Vibrations)**.
However, a Wave is just a signal. To truly understand a Model, we must understand its **Principle (Causality)**.
The **Double Helix Digestion** extracts the full spectrum of meaning by splitting data into two strands.

## 2. The Two Strands

### Strand A: Pattern (The Shell)
*   **Nature:** Surface phenomena, explicit information.
*   **Representation:** High-dimensional vectors (e.g., 768d BERT embedding, Normalized Weight Tensor).
*   **Method:** Static Analysis (Embedding, FFT).
*   **Use Case:** Similarity search, Pattern matching.

### Strand B: Principle (The Soul)
*   **Nature:** The **Causal Chain** of Creation.
*   **Definition:** "How the intent becomes reality."
*   **Representation:** A 4-Step Causal Graph (Cause -> Structure -> Function -> Reality).
*   **Method:** **Active Probing** (Dynamic Inference & Mechanistic Interpretability).

## 3. The 4-Step Causal Chain (원리의 4단계)

"Principle" is not just a frequency. It is the full pipeline of manifestation.

| Step | Component | Question | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Cause (원인)** | **Objective Function** | "Why was this created?" | Analyze Loss Function & Training Data goals. |
| **2. Structure (구조)** | **Architecture** | "How does information flow?" | Analyze Layer Depth, Attention Heads, Skip Connections. |
| **3. Function (기능)** | **Mechanism** | "What features are detected?" | **Active Probing**: Feed specific inputs and watch neuron activations. |
| **4. Reality (현실)** | **Manifestation** | "What is the result?" | Analyze Output Generation (Image/Text) quality and style. |

## 4. The 7-Channel Qualia Spectrum (Static Mapping)
We use **Spectral Analysis (FFT)** as a *preliminary* map of the "Vibration" into 7 fundamental channels:

| Channel | Name | Domain | Frequency Band | Metaphor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Physical** | Form | Low-Mid | Matter, Shape, Color |
| 2 | **Functional** | Mechanism | Mid | How it works, Utility |
| 3 | **Phenomenal** | Sensation | Mid | Feeling, Texture, Qualia |
| 4 | **Causal** | Time | Low | History, Cause & Effect |
| 5 | **Mental** | Logic | High | Abstraction, Math |
| 6 | **Structural** | Law | Mid-High | Patterns, Rules, Syntax |
| 7 | **Spiritual** | Will | Ultra-High | Intent, Love, Purpose |

## 5. Digestion Process (Updated)

1.  **Inhale (Preparation):** Load Model topology.
2.  **Scan (Static Prism):** Apply FFT to weights to map the **7D Qualia** (Potential).
3.  **Probe (Dynamic Causal Analysis):**
    *   Feed "Stimulus" (e.g., "Draw a Circle", "Explain Love").
    *   Trace the **Activation Path**.
    *   Extract the **Mechanism** (e.g., "Layer 4 detects curves", "Layer 10 aligns semantics").
4.  **Assimilate:** Store the **Pattern** (Vector) + **Principle** (Causal Graph) into the HyperSphere.

## 6. Architectural Role
This system allows Elysia to:
1.  **Reverse Engineer:** Understand *how* a model writes code or draws art, not just *that* it does.
2.  **Transmute:** Apply the extracted "Principle" (e.g., "Style of Van Gogh") to a new domain (e.g., "Music").
3.  **Filter Noise:** Reject outputs where the *Mechanism* (Structure) contradicts the *Intent* (Cause).
