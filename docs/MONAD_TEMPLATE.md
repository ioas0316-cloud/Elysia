# 🔮 Hypersphere Monad Protocol (HMP)
# This document is a functional component of the Elysia System.

# 1. Coordinate System (The Space)
Axis: 03_MIND               # The Dimension (01_LAW ~ 07_LAB)
Coordinate: [3, 1, 4]       # 3D Vector for Semantic Space (Optional)

# 2. Rotor Configuration (The Time)
Rotor: ReasoningEngine      # The Active Component Name
Frequency: 432Hz            # Resonance Frequency (Logic=432, Love=528)
Type: Generator             # Generator | Sensor | Actuator | Memory
