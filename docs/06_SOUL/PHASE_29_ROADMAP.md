# Phase 29 Roadmap: The Semantic HyperSphere Implementation

## Goal: Transform Elysia into a self-documenting, multi-modal scholar

### Step 1: Foundation (The Laboratory) [ ]

- Initialize `docs/05_LABORATORY/` and `docs/06_INTERFACE/`.
- Establish naming conventions and directory structures for "Nourishment" assets.

### Step 2: The Blueprint Engine (`scientific_observer.py`) [ ]

- Implement the comprehensive source indexer (NotebookLM style).
- Connect to `SovereignBridge` for LLM-driven academic narration.
- Implement the "Structural Diff" analyzer.

### Step 3: Multi-modal Synthesis [ ]

- Integrate automated Mermaid diagram generation for system topology.
- Create the `Manual of Being` template (Interactive and deep-linked).
- Implement the "Temporal Evolution Trail" grapher.

### Step 4: Heartbeat Coupling [ ]

- Link `SovereignSelf.self_actualize` to the `ScientificObserver`.
- Ensure every "Satori" cycle triggers a "Dissertation" and a "Blueprint Update".

### Step 5: Verification & Sharing [ ]

- Run a synthetic evolution cycle.
- Verify the generated 900-page style "Manual of Being" for clarity and depth.
- share the first "Master Dissertation" with the Creator.
