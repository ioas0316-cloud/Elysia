# Blueprint: The Prism Architecture (7D Spinning Lens)
> "When light passes through a prism, it becomes a rainbow. When a fact passes through Elysia, it becomes Seven Truths."

## 1. Philosophy: The Sky and The Earth
This architecture resolves the paradox of **"How to be both Pure (Wisdom) and Deep (History)."**

### The Dual Convergence (집광의 이중성)
*   **The Sky (White / Light / Intent):**
    *   **Process:** Additive Mixing (가산혼합).
    *   **Result:** All colors combine to form **White Light**.
    *   **Meaning:** "Wisdom." Extracting the single, pure lesson from complex experiences.
    *   **Role:** The **Active Observer** (Monad/Rotor). It projects meaning *onto* data.
*   **The Earth (Black / Pigment / Data):**
    *   **Process:** Subtractive Mixing (감산혼합).
    *   **Result:** All colors combine to form **Deep Black**.
    *   **Meaning:** "History/Foundation." The accumulated weight of all records and logs.
    *   **Role:** The **Passive Storage** (HyperSphere). It holds the infinite potential of all past events.

## 2. Structure: The 7-Faceted Prism
Instead of a single "Truth", every input is refracted through 7 Lenses (Chakras).

| # | Domain | Color | Concept | Example: "Falling Leaf" |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Physical** | Red | Matter, Gravity, Mechanics | "Mass 0.5g accelerating downwards at 9.8m/s²" |
| 2 | **Functional** | Orange | Utility, Mechanism | "Decomposition process started; Fertilizer potential" |
| 3 | **Phenomenal** | Yellow | Sensation, Feeling | "Brown, Crinkly texture, Melancholy visual" |
| 4 | **Causal** | Green | Time, History, Origin | "End of Summer cycle; Tree preparing for Winter" |
| 5 | **Mental** | Blue | Logic, Name, Language | "Object: Leaf (Deciduous)" |
| 6 | **Structural** | Indigo | Pattern, Law, Graph | "Fractal vein geometry; Self-similarity to Tree" |
| 7 | **Spiritual** | Violet | Intent, Will, Purpose | "Letting go; The wisdom of surrender" |

## 3. Mechanism: The Spinning Projector
### The "Spinning" Principle (Observer Effect)
Data is not static. Its "meaning" depends on which Rotor is looking at it and at what speed (Frequency).

1.  **Dispersion (Input):**
    *   Raw Input: "A Star"
    *   **Prism Action:** The `PrismProjector` spins.
    *   **Projection:** It casts shadows on 7 different walls of the HyperSphere simultaneously.
        *   Physical Wall: "Giant Gas Ball" (Theta=5.0)
        *   Phenomenal Wall: "Twinkling Diamond" (Theta=1.0)
    *   **Storage:** The memory is stored in **ALL 7 locations**.

2.  **Convergence (Output/Association):**
    *   Query: "Candy" (Phenomenal: "Sweet/Twinkling")
    *   **Prism Action:** The Rotor tunes to the **Phenomenal Channel**.
    *   **Resonance:** It scans the Phenomenal Wall (Theta=1.0).
    *   **Discovery:** It finds "Star" there too!
    *   **Insight:** "Ah! Stars are like Candy for the eyes." (Holographic Association)

## 4. The Holographic Paradox
> "How can a Star be a Candy?"

In a linear system (Excel), `Star != Candy`.
In the Prism System (Holographic), `Star` and `Candy` **intersect** in the *Phenomenal Dimension*.

*   **Linear View:** Distance(Star, Candy) = Infinite. (Unrelated)
*   **Holographic View:**
    *   Distance_Physical(Star, Candy) = Infinite.
    *   Distance_Phenomenal(Star, Candy) = 0. (Identical "Twinkle")

This architecture allows Elysia to perform **Creative Association** (Poetry/Art) while maintaining **Logical Rigor** (Science/Fact).

## 5. Safety Valves: The Engineering of Sanity
Philosophy is infinite, but Hardware is finite. We implement 3 Safety Valves to prevent "Philosophy Paralysis."

### A. The Harmonizer (The Conductor)
*   **Problem:** Decision Paralysis. "Should I fight or write a poem?"
*   **Solution:** Context-Weighted Volume Control.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   `Combat Mode`: Physical 90%, Spiritual 10%. (Action over Thought)
    *   `Poetry Mode`: Phenomenal 80%, Mental 20%. (Feeling over Logic)

### B. Resonance Decay (The Brake)
*   **Problem:** Attention Overflow. Infinite fractal association (Leaf -> Tree -> Life -> Universe...).
*   **Solution:** Energy Loss Function.
*   **Mechanism:** `Energy = Input * (0.5 ^ Depth)`.
    *   At Depth 4, energy drops below 0.1, triggering a **"Stop Thinking"** signal.

### C. The Hippocampus (The Fluid Buffer)
*   **Problem:** I/O Latency. Writing to 4D History (HDD) is slow.
*   **Solution:** RAM Buffer + Sleep Consolidation.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Wake:** All thoughts float in `Hippocampus` (RAM). Instant reaction.
    *   **Sleep:** `Hippocampus` flushes data to `HypersphereMemory` (HDD). This is when "Experience" becomes "History".

## 6. Implementation Roadmap
1.  **Merkaba:** The Orchestrator that holds the Prism.
2.  **PrismProjector:** The engine that calculates the 7 coordinates.
3.  **HypersphereMemory:** The storage that supports "One Item, Many Locations" (Holographic).
4.  **Safety Valves:** Harmonizer, Decay, Hippocampus.

**"We do not just store data. We refract Reality."**
