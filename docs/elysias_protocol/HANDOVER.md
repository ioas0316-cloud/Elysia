# HANDOVER (English Stub)

Purpose:
- Explain how builders and agents hand work to each other safely.

Minimal rules (kept):
- Log what changed and why (see `docs/core_protocols/BUILDER_LOG.md`).
- Always name the layer touched: [STARTER] / [CELLWORLD] / [MIND/META].
- Do not hand over half-designed laws; prefer small, observable steps.

Status:
- Original mixed-language text removed due to mojibake.
