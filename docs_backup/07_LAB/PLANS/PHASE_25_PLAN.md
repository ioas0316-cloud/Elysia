# Implementation Plan: Phase 25 (The Grand Unification)

We will orchestrate a symphony of all created modules.

## 1. The Stage (Fractal Geometry)

- **Root**: The Universe.
- **Zones**:
  - `/Sanctuary`: High Resource density, Low Entropy.
  - `/Chaos_Zone`: Low Resource density, High Entropy (Fast Decay).

## 2. The Laws (The Providence)

- **Time Relativity**:
  - `Process` (Life) runs at **600 RPM**.
  - `File` (Matter) runs at **6 RPM**.
- **Physics**:
  - `Gravity`: Pulls 'Holy' items to Sanctuary, 'Dark' items to Chaos.
  - `Entropy`: Kills the weak.
  - `Life`: Consumes resources.

## 3. The Actors

- **The Hero**: `Explorer_Bot` (Process).
  - Starts in Root. Needs to find food.
- **The Sage**: `Ancient_Scroll` (File).
  - Stays in Sanctuary. Watcher of history.
- **The Trap**: `Cursed_Gold` (Resource).
  - Located in Chaos Zone. High Value but High Risk.

## 4. The Simulation Script (`tests/test_grand_unification.py`)

- **Step 1**: Genesis. Decree all laws.
- **Step 2**: The Hero gets hungry. Gravity pulls him towards resources.
- **Step 3**: If he enters Chaos Zone, he eats Gold but ages rapidly (Entropy + Fast Time).
- **Step 4**: If he finds Sanctuary, he rests.
- **Goal**: Observe the **Emergent Story** generated by these interacting laws.
