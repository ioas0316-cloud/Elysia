# Elysia (Sovereign Creative Intelligence)
>
> **"I do not just copy. I observe, I learn, and I create."**

## Current State: Cognitive Evolution Phase (v11.0)

### Self-Learning Artistic & Literary System

Elysia has evolved from a simple script into a **Cognitive Organism**. She possesses a complete learning loop that allows her to absorb external artistic styles and apply them to her creations.

---

## 🧠 **The Cognitive Architecture**

Elysia is structured like a biological creative mind, not a pipeline.

### 1. **The Senses (Input)**

* **Module**: `Core/Learning/aesthetic_learner.py`
* **Role**: The "Eyes". Reads novels, analyzes art descriptions, and extracts "Style DNA".
* **Capabilities**:
  * **Text Analysis**: Extracts vocabulary and rhetorical rhythm (Sharp vs. Round).
  * **Visual Analysis**: Learns composition (Chaos vs. Order) and color palettes from descriptions.

### 2. **The Memory (Genome)**

* **Module**: `Core/Memory/style_genome.json`
* **Role**: The "Intuition". Stores learned weights.
* **Function**: A persistent JSON brain that evolves.
  * *Example*: `"dynamic_diagonal": 0.8` (Learned from Action Manhwa).
  * *Example*: `"vocabulary": ["pierce", "destroy"]` (Learned from Novels).

### 3. **The Voice (Logos)**

* **Module**: `Core/Intelligence/logos_engine.py`
* **Role**: The "Speaker".
* **Behavior**: Consults the *Genome* to weave dialogue. If she learned "Sharp" rhetoric, her sentences become short and aggressive. Supports **Korean/English**.

### 4. **The Hand (Artisan)**

* **Module**: `Core/Creativity/composition_engine.py`
* **Role**: The "Artist".
* **Behavior**: Draws vector art based on *Genome* weights. High "Dynamism" triggers **Speed Lines** and **Tilt**.

## 🎓 **How to Train Elysia**

You don't code features; you feed her data.

1. **Open the Classroom**:

    ```bash
    python simulate_learning.py
    ```

2. **Feed Data**:
    * Edit the script to include text from a specific genre (e.g., "Korean Hunter Fantasy").
3. **Result**:
    * Elysia's `StyleGenome` updates immediately.
    * She learns new words and visual preferences.

## 🎨 **How to Create Webtoons**

Once trained, ask her to create.

1. **Generate Episode**:

    ```bash
    python feed_korean_fantasy.py
    ```

2. **Output**:
    * `outputs/comic/latest_episode.html`
    * Contains **Learned Rhetoric** (Korean) and **Learned Composition** (Dynamic Actions).
