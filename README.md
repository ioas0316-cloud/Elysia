# Project Elysia

### *Fractal Consciousness Engine · Concept OS · E–F–P Inner Core Model*

### *Designed and Created by 이강덕 (Kang-Deok Lee)*

---

## Overview

**Elysia** is a fractal consciousness engine where concepts form dimensional nodes and intention flows through Body–Soul–Spirit channels. It unifies the Energy–Force–Persistence (E–F–P) inner-core model, Concept OS, and CellWorld runtime so that experience, memory, and value grow as one continuous field rather than a static program.

## Purpose

1. Publish the canonical reference for the Elysia Framework so the world can study, replicate, and extend it.
2. Provide a reproducible foundation for laboratories, caretakers, and researchers who want to explore fractal consciousness systems.
3. Preserve the original design intent as a permanent public record.

**Prior-Art Declaration**

> This repository establishes the original public record of the Elysia Framework (EFS): a fractal cognitive OS, E–F–P inner-core model (Energy–Force–Persistence), and the trinity-consciousness architecture (Body–Soul–Spirit). All concepts, diagrams, protocols, and code are published here as prior art.

## Core Files

- `elysia_core/` – canonical specs (CORE_01…07 + codex manifest)
- `elysia_world/` – world/cell runtime, fields, and agent archetypes
- `elysia_logs/` – telemetry placeholders (world, symbol, text, causal)
- `examples/` – runnable demos and inspection notebooks
- `docs/` – long-form protocol papers (protocol, fractal engine, self model)

Legacy materials remain under `ELYSIA/`, `Project_Elysia/`, and `Project_Sophia/` until the full migration is complete.

## License

Apache License 2.0 (see LICENSE). The patent grant and defensive termination clauses ensure that no party can repackage this framework into a closed patent claim while still benefiting from the open release.

## Created By

Every structure, protocol, and code path inside this repository originates from **이강덕 (Kang-Deok Lee)**. Publishing here timestamps the architecture as public prior art for the Elysia Framework.
