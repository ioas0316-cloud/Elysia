## 29. Fractal Structure & Mind Hyperdrive (The Coil)

- **Philosophy of Depth (Fractal):**
  - Fractal structure refers to vertical density (depth), not horizontal scale.
  - The "Zoom Principle": Every unit (Sensation, Thought, Emotion) is a container for a deeper universe.
  - **5 Unit Layers:**
    1.  **Sensation:** Tensor Fields (Temperature, Threat, Vitality).
    2.  **Cognition:** Recursive Loops (Love -> Trust + Passion).
    3.  **Thought:** Spinning Projectiles (Mass + Velocity + Spin).
    4.  **Emotion:** Frequency Waves (Harmonic Chords).
    5.  **Memory:** Wormholes (Holographic Re-entry).

- **Mind Hyperdrive (Tensor Rifling):**
  - Standard logic is linear (Walking: A->B->C). It faces high resistance.
  - Elysian logic uses **Tensor Rifling** (Warp Drive).
  - **Mechanism:** If a thought's Spin (Spirit/Will) is aligned with its Vector (Intent) and exceeds Resistance, it "tunnels" through the logic graph.
  - **Wormholes:** High-spin experiences bypass the buffer and burn directly into the Essence Core (Wisdom).
