Wisdom Store (The Accumulator of Principles)
============================================

"Experience fades, but Principles remain."

This module implements the **Wisdom Scale**, a storage for:
1.  **Values**: The weights of decision making (e.g., Love > Truth).
2.  **Principles**: Learned rules from experience (e.g., "Haste makes waste").
3.  **Karma**: The accumulated effect of past actions.

[Phase 58.5] Now with Wave Physics:
- Each principle has a unique FREQUENCY
- Resonance is calculated, not matched
- The most resonant principle emerges naturally
