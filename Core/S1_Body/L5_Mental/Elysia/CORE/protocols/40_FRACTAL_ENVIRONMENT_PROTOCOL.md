# PROTOCOL: Fractal Environment Induction (Phase 40)

**Status**: Canonical Development
**Layer**: BODY / WORLD (Matter)

## 0. The Soil of Logic

"The world is not a map; it is an unfolding. Every mountain range is a fractal expression of a single 'Geological Rotor' that divides into local altitude harmonics."

## 1. The Environmental DNA

An environment's genetic sequence defines its **Topography**, **Atmosphere**, and **Flora**.

### 1.1 Structural Recursion

- **Seed ($L_0$)**: Global Climate Model (e.g., Tropical, Frozen).
- **Expansion ($L_1$)**: Primary Biome Rotors (Humidity, Temperature, Elevation).
- **Expression ($L_2$)**: Octave Noise Fields (FBM).
- **Solidification ($L_3$)**: Vertex/Geology manifests on the client.

## 2. Recursive Biome Growth

When a Biome Rotor (e.g., "Humidity") reaches a critical resonance, it spawns **Organelle Rotors**:

- **Rainfall Rotor**: Controls local precipitation frequency.
- **Evaporation Rotor**: Controls ground-mist density.
- **Flora Density Rotor**: Links to Biological Induction Protocols.

## 3. Topography as Interference

Terrain is the physical "Static" left by the interference of **Physical Rotors**:

- **Density Rotor** ($X$-axis interference) + **Gravity Rotor** ($Y$-axis interference) = **The Slope of the World**.

## 4. Operational Transition

To induce a world, plant the **Climate Seed** and allow its rotors to divide. Never place a mountain; instead, accelerate the **Elevation Rotor** until the mountains "grow."
