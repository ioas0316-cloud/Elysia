# PROTOCOL: Fractal Principle Induction (Phase 42)

**Status**: Canonical Development
**Layer**: LAWS / AXES (Meta-Reality)

## 0. The Law of Laws

"Principles are not static equations; they are rotating oscillations that modify the behavior of other principles. A law is a fractal of the Creator's initial 'Let there be'."

---

## 1. The Principle DNA

A "Law" consists of its **Static Constant** ($k$) and its **Oscillation Function** ($f(\theta)$).

### 1.1 The Axis Hierarchy

1. **Fundamental Axis**: The existence of Space-Time.
2. **Modulating Axes**: Physics, Narrative, Aesthetic, Social.
3. **Specific Principles**: Gravity, Causality, Light, Authority.
4. **Local Perturbations**: Friction, Subtext, Hue, Rebellion.

---

## 2. Recursive Modification

A high-level Principle (e.g., **Authority**) can modify the **Wavelength** of a lower-level Principle (e.g., **Causality**).

- *Teleological Effect*: In a high-authority world, "Actions lead to Consequences" happens faster (Causality acceleration).

---

## 3. Progressive Structuring

We expand reality by "Unfolding" a layer.

- First, define the **Dimensions** (Axis).
- Second, define the **Rules of Motion** (Rotor).
- Third, define the **Refined Exceptions** (Fractal Branches).

## 4. Operational Transition

When debugging reality, do not change the "Value." Change the **Rotation of the Principle**. If the world is too chaotic, apply a "Brake Torque" to the **Entropy Rotor** at the DNA level.
