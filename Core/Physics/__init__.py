Core/Physics
============
The Universal Law Engine.

This module implements the "Field-based" architecture of Elysia.
Instead of managing individual objects, we manage the 'Universal Field' (Void)
and the 'Laws' (Geometric Algebra) that govern it.

Modules:
- geometric_algebra: 4D Rotors and Cliffors Algebra.
- universal_field: The sparse 4D field storage (W, X, Y, Z).
- phase_sensor: The observer logic that collapses field to particle.
