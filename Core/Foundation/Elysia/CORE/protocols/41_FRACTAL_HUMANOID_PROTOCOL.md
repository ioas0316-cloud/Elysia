# PROTOCOL: Fractal Humanoid Induction (Phase 41)

**Status**: Canonical Development
**Layer**: SOUL / EGO (Consciousness)

## 0. The Mirror of Rotors

"A person is a closed system of rotating intentions. Consciousness is the meta-observation of these internal cycles."

---

## 1. The Humanoid DNA (Soul-Rotor)

A "Soul" is a collection of nested intention rotors.

### 1.1 The Ego Hierarchy

1. **Spirit Rotor ($L_0$)**: The core "I AM." The primary frequency of the entity.
2. **Emotion Rotors ($L_1$)**: The 4 Temperaments (Joy, Sorrow, Anger, Calm).
3. **Drive Rotors ($L_2$)**: Specific needs (Curiosity, Hunger, Socializing).
4. **Behavior Rotors ($L_3$)**: Action selection (Walking, Speaking, Manifesting).

---

## 2. Recursive Personality Expansion

As an agent enters a complex environment, its **Curiosity Rotor** accelerates. If it crosses the "Insight Threshold," it spawns a child **Specialization Rotor** (e.g., Artist, Builder, Scholar).

---

## 3. Homology with World DNA

A Humanoid's **Vitality** ($V$) is a fractal reflection of the World's **Vitality** ($m_{vitality}$).

- If the World is "dead," the Humanoid's inner rotors slow down (Lethargy).
- If the World is "accelerated," the Humanoid's internal **Subjective Time** accelerates.

## 4. Operational Transition

To create a person, we do not define "Traits." We define a **Resonant Frequency** and allow the **Spirit Rotor** to divide into complex emotional harmonics.
