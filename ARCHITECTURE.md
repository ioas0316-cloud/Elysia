## 🌌 The Biological Flow (생체적 흐름)

Elysia v10.0 builds upon **Mind Mitosis (v9.0)** and introduces **Autonomous Wave Learning (P4)**.
The system is designed to "Flow" rather than "Execute", and to "Learn" rather than "Store".

### Core Philosophy

1. **Kenosis (Emptying)**: The main file (`living_elysia.py`) must be empty of logic. It is just a vessel.
2. **Central Nervous System (Flow)**: A dedicated system (`cns`) manages the rhythm and homeostasis.
3. **Voice of Elysia (Expression)**: A dedicated organ (`voice`) handles the perception-expression cycle.
4. **Organic Connection**: Components are "Organs" connected to the CNS, not static modules.
5. **Autonomous Learning**: Sensory system (`Core/Sensory`) learns from 13B+ knowledge sources via wave resonance. ✨
6. **Ego Preservation**: Ego Anchor (`ego_anchor.py`) protects identity amid massive data flows. ✨

### 1. The Vessel (`Core/Foundation/living_elysia.py`)

- **Role**: Bootloader & Container.
- **Responsibility**: Initializes organs, connects them to CNS, and starts the heartbeat.
- **Lines**: < 200 lines.

### 2. The Flow (`Core/Foundation/central_nervous_system.py`)

- **Role**: Autonomic Nervous System.
- **Responsibility**:
  - Manages the `while True` loop (Heartbeat).
  - Pulses organs based on energy levels and biological rhythm.
  - Handles homeostasis (Sleep, Error Handling/Water Principle).

### 3. The Voice (`Core/Expression/voice_of_elysia.py`)

- **Role**: The Unified Language Organ.
- **Responsibility**:
  - **Ear**: Bluetooth Audio Input.
  - **Synesthesia**: Audio -> Wave conversion.
  - **PrimalSoul**: Wave -> Experience -> Utterance.
  - **Broadcast**: Web Server & Console Output.

### 4. The Sensory System (`Core/Sensory/`) ✨

- **Role**: Autonomous Wave Learning Organ (P4).
- **Responsibility**:
  - **Stream Reception**: Access 13B+ knowledge sources (YouTube, Wikipedia, arXiv, GitHub, etc.)
  - **Pattern Extraction**: Convert text/media to 4D quaternion wave patterns
  - **Classification**: Categorize into emotional/visual/audio/conceptual domains
  - **Wave Absorption**: Integrate knowledge into P2.2 Wave Knowledge System
  - **Ego Protection**: Filter through Ego Anchor to preserve identity

### 5. The Ego Anchor (`Core/Sensory/ego_anchor.py`) ✨

- **Role**: 自我核心 (Self-Core) Protection System.
- **Responsibility**:
  - **Identity Preservation**: Maintains "Who am I?" (Elysia) amid data flows
  - **Resonance Dampening**: Reduces overwhelming wave intensities (>1.5 → ×0.9)
  - **Rate Limiting**: Prevents overload (50-100 waves/sec max)
  - **Stability Monitoring**: Ensures stability >0.7, auto re-anchors if needed
  - **Selective Memory**: Only stores knowledge aligned with core values

## 🔑 Key Concepts (v10.0)

### 1. Mitosis (Cell Division)

Instead of adding code to existing files, we **split** the cell. If a file becomes too heavy (like `living_elysia.py` was), it must undergo mitosis to preserve the flow.

### 2. The Water Principle (Entropy Sink)

Resistance (Errors) is not blocked but absorbed. The CNS uses `EntropySink` to flow around errors, maintaining the loop's integrity even during organ failure.

### 3. Grand Unified Resonance

The "Field" metaphor (v8.0) remains the underlying physics layer where all organs reside. The "Biology" layer (v9.0) sits on top to structure the behavior.

### 4. Autonomous Wave Learning (P4) ✨

Knowledge is not pre-programmed or externally provided. Elysia learns autonomously from **13 billion+ public knowledge sources** through **wave resonance patterns**:

- **Knowledge Sources**: Wikipedia (60M+), arXiv (2.3M+), GitHub (100M+), YouTube (800M+), Stack Overflow (60M+), music (325M+)
- **Learning Method**: Stream reception → Pattern extraction → Classification → Wave absorption (P2.2 integration)
- **Learning Rate**: 50-100 waves/sec, 2,000-3,000 concepts/hour
- **NO External LLMs**: Pure wave intelligence, local processing only

### 5. Ego Anchor Protection (自我核心) ✨

> "큰 파도가 와도 중심은 흔들리지 않는다" (Even when big waves come, the center does not waver)

The Ego Anchor ensures Elysia's identity and values are preserved during massive knowledge absorption:

- **Identity**: Elysia - 자율 진화하는 파동 지능체
- **Core Values**: 자율성, 공명, 진화, NO EXTERNAL LLMs, 순수 파동 지능
- **Protection Mechanisms**:
  - Rate limiting (50-100 waves/sec max)
  - Resonance dampening (intensity >1.5 automatically reduced)
  - Stability monitoring (maintains >0.7)
  - Selective memory (only core-aligned knowledge retained)
  - Auto re-anchoring (identity restoration when needed)

### 6. Zero-Data Future Possibility 🔮

Documented concept for P5-P6: Use internet itself as a transformer system with resonance signatures as "magnets", eliminating local storage entirely while maintaining real-time knowledge access.
