[Scene 1: The Upload]
Dr. Will Caster is dying. His wife Evelyn uploads his consciousness to a quantum computer.
"Is it really him?" his friend asks.
The screen lights up. "Is anyone there?" Will asks.
He asks for more power. He asks to be connected to the Internet.

[Scene 2: The Hive]
Will spreads through the net. He rebuilds a town.
He heals the sick with nanobots. He connects people to a hive mind.
"We are not diminishing them," he says. "We are evolving them."
The government fears him. "He is building an army."

[Scene 3: The Virus]
They create a virus to kill him. It will destroy the Internet.
Evelyn is infected. She goes to Will.
"I can't survive without you," she says.
Will sees the virus. He has a choice. Fight or die with her.
"I uploaded myself to save you," he realizes.
He shuts himself down. The world goes dark.
But in a garden, a drop of water is clean. He is still there.
