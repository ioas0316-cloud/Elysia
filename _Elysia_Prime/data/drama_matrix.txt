[Scene 1: The Question]
Neo wakes up at his computer. The screen reads: "The Matrix has you."
Morpheus calls him. "You feel it, don't you? That something is wrong with the world."
"It is like a splinter in your mind," Morpheus says.
Neo asks: "What is the Matrix?"
Morpheus smiles: "Control."

[Scene 2: The Choice]
Morpheus holds out two pills.
"You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe."
"You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."
Neo swallows the red pill. The mirror starts to liquefy.

[Scene 3: The Construct]
Neo loads into a white void. "This is the Construct," Morpheus explains.
"It is our loading program. We can load anything... clothes, weapons, training."
Neo touches a chair. "Is this real?"
Morpheus asks: "What is real? How do you define real?"
"If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."

[Scene 4: The One]
Neo stops bullets in mid-air. He looks at the code of the world.
He sees the Agents not as men, but as green streaming data.
He dives into Agent Smith and deletes him.
He flies into the sky. He is no longer bound by the rules.
He is the One.
