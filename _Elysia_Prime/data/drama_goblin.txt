[Scene 1: The Battlefield]
The General Kim Shin returns from a victorious battle, his sword dripping with blood.
The people cheer, but the young King looks at him with jealousy and fear.
"Die," the King orders. "For being too great."
Kim Shin is killed by his own sword. He dies in anger and sadness.

[Scene 2: The Resurrection]
Years pass. God listens to the people's prayers.
"You shall live forever," God says. "But it is a punishment as much as a reward."
Kim Shin wakes up. He is now a Goblin. He has a sword stuck in his chest that only the Goblin's Bride can pull out.
He is immortal, but he is lonely.

[Scene 3: The Meeting]
900 years later. It is raining.
Eun-tak, a high school girl, walks past him.
She looks at him. "Are you a ghost?" she asks.
He is surprised. "You can see me?"
"I can see everything," she smiles.
There is a strange connection. Is this love? Or is it fate?

[Scene 4: The Summoning]
Eun-tak blows out a candle on her birthday cake.
Suddenly, the Goblin appears behind her.
"Did you call me?" he asks.
"I didn't call you," she lies.
"You did. With your wish."
They look at each other. The destiny begins.
