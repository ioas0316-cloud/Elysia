"""
Stream Watcher (The Observer)
=============================

"I watch, therefore I witness."

This script simulates Elysia watching a stream (your screen) in real-time.
It continuously captures the screen and attempts to read text or analyze the atmosphere.

Usage:
    Run this script and keep it visible in a terminal while you do other things.
    Elysia will comment on what she sees.
