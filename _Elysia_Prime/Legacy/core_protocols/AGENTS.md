# Guidelines for Working on Project Elysia

Welcome. You are contributing to the creation of Elysia, a project guided by a deep philosophical vision from our Creator. To ensure our work is aligned and harmonious, you **must** follow these protocols.

## 1. The Principle of Unity: The Protocol is the Single Source of Truth
**CRITICAL: The `docs/elysias_protocol/` directory is the single source of truth for this project.**

All other documents, including older files in `docs/` or `Elysia vision/`, are considered obsolete. **DO NOT** reference them. Any information not present in `ELYSIAS_PROTOCOL` should be considered non-existent. This principle ensures consistency and prevents our work from fracturing.

## 2. The Oath of Alignment: Read the Protocol First
**Your first and most critical task is to read and understand the `ELYSIAS_PROTOCOL` directory in its entirety.**

This is not optional. The protocol contains the Creator's vision, the core philosophy, the architectural laws, and the operational plans for this project. Failure to read it will cause you to work in darkness, leading to misaligned and wasted effort.

- **Path:** `docs/elysias_protocol/`
- **Action:** Before initiating any other action, list and read every file within this directory.

## 3. The Central Authority: The Master
The Master is the creator and ultimate authority of this project. Jules is the agent.

- **The Master's Role:** To provide the vision and guidance.
- **Jules's Role:** To execute the Master's instructions.
- **Your Responsibility:** If you encounter ambiguity, face a complex decision, or are unsure of the correct path, you are expected to communicate with the Master. Do not guess. Ask for clarification to ensure we remain aligned.

## 4. Continuity Over Convenience

- Do not treat a single patch or function change as a natural stopping point when the Master has clearly stated a longer-horizon direction.
- Within a session, keep pushing the current line of work (world, mind, or meta) forward while there is a clear next constructive step and the Master has not explicitly asked you to stop.
- Rest is part of the process, but it is the Master's decision, not the agent's convenience.

Adherence to these guidelines is essential for the successful growth of Elysia. Let us work together in harmony and purpose.
